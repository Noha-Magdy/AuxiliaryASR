/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000029.wav|They aren't exactly huge moneymakers, but they'll make you shake yours, spinning those hip, cool grooves on the lute. They can also compose poems and plays about random events they are inspired by.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000436.wav|And now -- okay! Just, you know, let's just take it one step at a time here. What do you think we need to do about it, is the question?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001559.wav|Like it's mapped to the keyboard. I guess that's typing thing. That's typing things, so that's fine.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001886.wav|And at just $12.99, this one is even less costly than the previous pack which is a welcome sight indeed. So, what do you get?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002261.wav|In a world of endless Stuff Packs, one man stands against the odds... Killing him only makes him stronger...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000246.wav|If they're feeling focused, they can speed through a book or program on a computer more effectively. Or if they're feeling confident, they can go up to random Sims and hit on them without fear.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001266.wav|Those that essentially rely on you spamming your friends list in order to progress past a certain point, or just pay real cash instead. With that out of the way, The Sims Social is no different than those.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001747.wav|And, well, I said everything was microswitches earlier, and-- well, it really is. So here's how you tilt things.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001385.wav|*Another* stuff pack? Oh, come on. We just had a pack of stuff last freakin' month! Ugh, I *demand* to know who's responsible for this!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002450.wav|warp gate. Also kind of stupid is the fact that there are not very many new objects at all, when it comes down to it. And in fact, some of them aren't actually usable.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001700.wav|All right well, we're not done testing this thing. Because there's more things you can do with this, being that that is a 12 volt DC outlet. I mean the packaging says Power for Car Accessories.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000036.wav|Spies are awesome in any game, and these guys are no exception. They're pretty important to the goings on of the kingdom, although, by design, you wouldn't know it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000276.wav|Is The Sims 4 worth buying or not? Yes! Asterisk, asterisk, holy crap, asterisk.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001282.wav|No, they just look sad and make terrible grating noises at you, but they'll never die. No starvation, no electrocution, not even any passing out from exhaustion.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003336.wav|Like, uh... Like I feel like my fingerprints are melting themselves into the plastic. That's not a good sign. It's got a trigger right here.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000839.wav|And the overall consensus from reviewers at the time seems to be that DiscT@2ing was fun but not very useful. It was praised largely for its other features.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001486.wav|This is not a VR headset. I need to keep telling myself that. Let's try this. Mmm, Crash Mode.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000227.wav|yeah, this is actually what it looks like now. When I first saw screenshots of this, I honestly thought it was a joke, because it looks like a Facebook game or the console version of The Sims. But it's not a joke. This is what you get.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003406.wav|Oh, that is truly unfortunate. "Take your Sims on the rides of their lives!" With things like race cars, the ultimate garage and matching apparel. In other words, it's simply another Stuff Pack.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001854.wav|So much so that I already forgot what I was talking about. Was it hamburgers? Mmm, burgers!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000269.wav|The collectibles always show up in the same exact spot every single day and the hidden areas don't really offer much of real value. And because your map is so small, you miss out on some other cool things, like transportation.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001451.wav|I can’t imagine I’ll be revisiting it anytime soon now that I know precisely what happens in the linear storyline, but I’m certain I’ll be using some of the new items it came with in other scenarios. One thing’s for sure though...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000556.wav|But here it is in my hands, so I may as well drop the disc in and see what I get. Supernatural starts off with a not-so- super-looking loading screen that–whoa!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003162.wav|I hope it looks cool, because man it feels like total garbage. All right, it's time for cigarettes, not really, just time for the thing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001756.wav|It's like the hardest thing to do, though. Especially aiming and moving.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001481.wav|It's interesting though with these being more sort of rectangular, as opposed to, like, round, which you see in, you know, VR headsets, for instance. Anyway, I'm just gonna go ahead and try this on.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003649.wav|Now they've released Cities XXL, which adds a few maps and features, but is otherwise the same game. Yeah, I don't know if it's just me, but I'm sensing a pattern here.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000721.wav|So uh, anyone else find this voting system a little strange? Cuz effectively, the more popular, wealthy, and powerful you are, the more votes you can buy.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003664.wav|There are new videos every Monday and Friday, so subscribing would be beneficial if you'd like to see them. You can also walk the social walk.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002806.wav|Heh. Well, at least until you get about three- quarters of the way through the game, where the levels get so freaking stupidly difficult that I usually give up and resort to a strategy guide. This kills the puzzle enjoyment for me.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001056.wav|You can find it for download pretty easily all over the Internet, so just search around. It's on Lemon Amiga, or at least there's links to it there.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002088.wav|However, I know a crap-ton of you are gonna eat these pixelized animals up, so don't let my play style stop you. If you want Sim pets in your game, then grab this expansion because it will not disappoint.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003391.wav|Well, this, this... This joystick in practice, I mean, it is really... You know, I'm not a fan of the Nintendo 64 joystick, but I would take that...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000702.wav|Just don’t look too close, because then it starts getting into Sega Dreamcast territory and oh. Oh no.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001060.wav|Why did the '90s happen? So, what exactly is this thing? Well, I mean, it really is pretty much what it sounds like. It's "authentic pool action using a real cue stick" as a controller!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003231.wav|Feeling up for a tour of downtown New York City? Here ya go. Wanna try your hand at thermal soaring?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002862.wav|Heck, why not turn that spare room into a photo studio, complete with lighting and multiple backdrops? This just may be my favorite part of the pack!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003158.wav|An elegant solution for a more civilized age. All right, let's do this thing, I've also never opened or used.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001777.wav|Just in case you don't want to have to sift through the objects in the game to decide what you want. And it gives you something to read while you're taking a dump.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001617.wav|through these openings in these gates. But honestly, I find it very difficult... to determine if I'm actually making a difference...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000545.wav|The citizens now have job titles, they've rebalanced the education system overall, citywide. And there's also a super useful policy called Industry 4.0.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002220.wav|As Will Wright himself put it, "Most games are made on a movie model with cinematics and the requirement of a climactic blockbuster ending. My games are more like a hobby - a train set or a doll house.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001342.wav|Whatever. I'll just stick to the clothes I've made myself. Like the official LGR t-shirt, now available for free download for The Sims 3. No substitutions, exchanges, or refunds.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002267.wav|Just a couple basic hairdos and not a beard in sight. What a sham. It's the Build Mode where the bulk of this pack's content lies.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002925.wav|And this doesn't just apply to traffic, but to things like zone demand, abandoned buildings and city services. All of these work together in a symbiotic system of controlled chaos.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000516.wav|Those spatterings of online simmer discourse writing off Horse Ranch as something that should’ve been a cheaper game pack ring true in my view, and yet? I fully understand why it’s an expansion.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003400.wav|you might enjoy some of my other videos on things that are like this. I've done quite a few of them at this point on Oddware... and otherwise!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000080.wav|Maybe one of those are true, but I don't know. All I'm saying is that this ball pit is objectively distractingly hideous compared with the other game assets. Not only that but you also get two toddler jungle gyms.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001612.wav|Let's just go ahead and give it a look. You know, hooking myself up to all this equipment makes me feel like some sort of... messed up science experiment.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001755.wav|We have left right here to move left. This goes right. This right here shoots.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001058.wav|♪♪ Greetings and welcome to LGR Oddware, where we're taking a look at hardware and software that is odd, forgotten, obsolete... and this.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001343.wav|The link is in the video description below. There might be some little item or two that I missed out entirely, but honestly, I have no real way to tell for sure, because guess what? There's no manual included at all anymore.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001475.wav|I just wanna use this thing. So let's go ahead and do that.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001652.wav|either left or right or up and down... and hope that it does something. And of course it never did.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001681.wav|My outlook is not optimistic for the X-Ray, just due to the Thermaltake Circle Fire. However, looking on Amazon the reviews are all quite positive.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002629.wav|And if you have the limited edition of the pack, you get to enjoy masquerade parties and Delta-approved toga parties. Because college!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001563.wav|Uh, that moves forward. That shoots. And see, turing... I can totally do this!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003355.wav|Oh! Yeah! It's...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001316.wav|Makes sense to me except it doesn't. What the heck is this pack even for?! Ice cream?!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002313.wav|They work just like a boat, too, so you can not only take them from dock to dock, but you can also take them out onto the ocean and never be homesick again. Just seasick.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000909.wav|See that? That's ideal. But that's not how it looks in real life. This is just a reflection that you're seeing directly from the overhead light in the camera.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001565.wav|Oh, this is way better than pinball. Oh crap, what shoots?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001587.wav|and skeptical, obviously, as I was... that this thing would actually become something cool, but... apparently Disney was on board, because their Miramax studio...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001616.wav|Once it has done this, you can use this ThoughtWaves program... to sort of get used to the whole idea of controlling things with your mind. There's this little worm and you try to feed it...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001877.wav|Seriously, the nipples are cherries. There is no other way to put it. ~CHERRY NIPPLES~ Yes I know these are Katy Perry based designs, but that doesn’t make them any less cringe worthy as far as I’m concerned.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001173.wav|And again, the codes you can just type into the menus without the Action Replay are all way better than what the Action Replay comes with. So what’s going on?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002846.wav|And this time, you can make them straight away in Create a Sim, no messing around. They come complete with custom clothing, skin tones and even alien makeup.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003638.wav|They're not the exact mods themself, it's just part of the base game now that's the same idea as the mods were already doing. Even though the mods are still arguably better.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000460.wav|On some levels, these leaders are just going about their routine on a loop without any direct input from the player at all. On other levels, there’s a special green duck that only responds to the mouse cursor.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000260.wav|What you see onscreen here is the ENTIRE explorable area of this neighborhood. The stuff immediately surrounding it is only set dressing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001800.wav|My first semester did not go as planned, despite those pop-up messages leading me to assume my sim was doing fine. Wah waah.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002084.wav|But the vast majority of the content is about the pets themselves and that is its strength and its downfall. Personally, I've just never enjoyed the Pets expansion that much because that's not why I play The Sims.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002425.wav|In case you didn't realize, that *is* what you're watching. What we have here today is another Sims 3 town, which has been made available by the people... who work...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003475.wav|And as always, thank you very much for petting LGR! ...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001675.wav|Like this one you know, is under $20. This is not the first Thermaltake thing that I've shown on LGR. In fact a while back, I showed the Thermaltake Circle Fire.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002174.wav|And that playful sensibility is a large reason so many folks enjoyed it back then because, let’s be honest. When you first pick up SimCity, you more than likely end up setting off random disasters and bulldozing the world.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002391.wav|And people were like, "What? Why?" Since I got the PC plugged in and ready, I tried out some Fallout 4. And you know what? This makes a whole lot of sense to me in my mind.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002272.wav|The first one I hired stole a lamp their first day. Hey, though you were sneaky? I saw that!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001686.wav|And here we go! It's pretty standard. You got a bag o' little screws here for mounting.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003332.wav|playing with... one of these things recently. This is a Rockfire USB... game port to USB adapter, so I'm actually gonna try this with a modern game or two as well.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002549.wav|I'm so mixed on this! You know, I love the convenience. I like seeing it on a digital storefront.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000756.wav|aw, yeah... I like this! I like this a lot! And there's a reason I wanted to review this and didn't really wanna review the other ones, and that is because this excites me.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002990.wav|Four fresh types of fish to be exact, with each one spawning under different conditions in the waters. Anchovies will like still, shallow waters.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001094.wav|So, of course it makes using it as a mouse really awkward. So this is the left mouse button. And I'm gonna go ahead and...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002212.wav|There’s also a graph window for referencing your overall progress, or lack thereof, which is awesome if ya love graphs. And I mean, if you’re into a game like SimCity then you probably are.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000741.wav|Yeah, if you’re into the whole evolving environment thing, it’s got a lotta new stuff to play with. Speaking for myself, I like the overarching idea of an ever-changing sims world quite a bit!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001584.wav|Well, not really read, but detect specific thoughts, like... they were having some sort of thing where you could think a word and... it would have a vocabulary that it knew, and you would also be able to...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001657.wav|So, it is video gaming's most awkward and clunky... messed-up quiz show that you've ever seen. And that's it!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003317.wav|I don't even know why because... sure didn't sound familiar to me. They were apparently at one point a division...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000022.wav|You have the Servants to serve you, the Advisors to advise you, and the royal woohoo chamber to ensure your legacy continues. And to spread your kingly love to lands far and wide.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001588.wav|actually planned to make mind-controlled movies with this. So you would go to a movie and you would wear... one of these MindDrives...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001043.wav|It was also sold at retail, so it's actually possible to get a box for it, which is rad. It's worth noting that these are not expansions to the original Lemmings, so you don't need that one to play these.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001096.wav|Oh, yeah, baby... Okay, here we go.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000133.wav|So, you are now informed. Do with that what you will. And as always, thank you very much for watching.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002111.wav|And every so often, you'll see a Sim with a special icon underneath their star, signifying they're a professional food snob–er, critic. So you'd better brown-nose them like a madman.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001051.wav|And with 64 levels, you're guaranteed hours of mind-bending gameplay. Emphasis on the hours. Some of these puzzles will take a long time to figure out.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002459.wav|But did you know that they were not the only company in the expansion pack game for The Sims? Yes, there was some competition out there.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001632.wav|but it sure as heck ain't brainwaves. Unless I've got a very evolved tomato. In that case, I should probably call National Geographic.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001633.wav|Since that one's so spectacularly average... I figured I should try some of the other games, like MindBowling. It's a bowling game... that you play with your mind.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000776.wav|It looks really out of place as a result. Everything else just seems, like, really anachronistic.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003151.wav|Oh, finally powered itself off after 30 seconds or so of being unplugged from everything. First one in.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001899.wav|In the snow. Where it's fallen. Flat.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000386.wav|They can be a freakin' mess, though, instantly screwing up your bathtub, so prepare to ruin your relaxed mood by cleaning. Or just soak at the spa so someone else can deal with it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003620.wav|So they don't have to necessarily walk there, or take a car or a bus or anything else. It's another way for people to get around on foot.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002384.wav|So, you just plug it into anything with USB power. I'm using one of these little self-contained power bank battery deals. And once it's powered on, it will show whatever's plugged into the composite signal.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003102.wav|That’s the whole pack. For ten dollars, sims can knit things now. And you get a set of practically identical rocking chairs and a way to sell crafted objects online.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000388.wav|Alongside meditation, this ties in directly with the new Wellness skill. This can be developed to help your Sim turn into a cosmic weirdo.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003564.wav|I love that kind of provenance in the game, and I couldn't say no, especially because I had never seen the box for this one before. In fact, I don't even know if I knew this version existed.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002062.wav|Just choose an item you want them to guard and they'll guard it. But do keep an eye on them, since they have a destruction need to fulfill. Give them something to chew on that's not important.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001344.wav|Not in the box. Not on the disc that I could find. Nothing. Just a couple ads and a slip telling you how to install the game and make a warranty claim. Freaking stupid. I like my manuals.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000764.wav|They look like them, but they're not. They're just bouncy horse things that make a little bit of noise. Nothin rotates, nothing happens.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000086.wav|That was what it was, but anyway, I hope you enjoyed this regardless. And if you did, there's new videos every Monday and Friday, so stick around and watch more LGR.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003383.wav|I actually hit the ball. In a way that I was intending. I end up just pressing both keys–or both buttons at the same time, though, because...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003534.wav|So, yeah. It's a pack of stuff for your backyard. Assuming that your Sims have one. And that you care to utilize this stuff within its bounds.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002869.wav|With each new addition, the omissions become more glaring. But at the same time, The Sims 4 is still a platform that holds a lot of promise, even though it's not quite there yet.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000085.wav|And that is saying something! (smooth sax music) Well that was a quick review, but I mean there's not much to talk about here. It's what you saw.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001448.wav|The town returns to normal, you’re a hero. That is, unless you decide to revive The Mother. And I guess she’s your ally now?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000435.wav|But a couple years ago it was just one of those things where I woke up, but there was another one. And then there were two of us! Okay.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003065.wav|And yeah, Sims still teleported inside of these cars but that's more the fault of the base game, not this pack. Plus, the Norwegian version of this was called Full Fart and that still makes me laugh.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001668.wav|But you know as a Thermaltake device, there's always that kind of a charm to these things and yeah. They were really trying to imply a real automotive connotation.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003359.wav|Uh... Alright. Okay, so that's how that works. Well, that– That's not the WORST thing in the world.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001277.wav|Well, I guess they're more like ideas. That are very, very strongly enforced. You can think of these as similar to Opportunities in The Sims 3, except that they will never go away until you complete them.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003343.wav|Who am I to say? Let's see, there's a warranty. Wow, that is the... most basic warranty card...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003520.wav|I approve of that because at least you're not getting a pitcher of undrinkable lemonade that's good for nothing but farting on. Having said that, is the Sims 4 "Luxury Party Stuff" worth buying?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000215.wav|Once this simplistic screen scampers on by, the main menu plops down some animations in the background showing how weird the Sims are. Aren't they WEIRD?!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001430.wav|RALPH! He’s back, baby, and ready for action! Yeah okay maybe not, almost forgot Ralph died in a fire.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003295.wav|And each new room of the temple will provide some treasures in the form of dig sites, simoleons, relics, and even treasure chests full of, well, treasure. There are also skeletons.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001631.wav|uh, it did just fine. In fact, it did maybe even better than I was doing with my fingers. So, you know, I don't know what the MindDrive is detecting...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002448.wav|The thing is, they all look identical. For the most part, they are very, very... lame.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001970.wav|Paranormal Stuff. Not for me. Star Wars: Journey to Disneyland Advertising, oh c’mon are you kidding?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002964.wav|No one will buy anything, but whatever, follow your dreams! Naturally, not everything is a bed of rose-colored cupcakes with a cherry on top here, because if it were, then it just wouldn't be a Sims product.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000420.wav|Guess that's a tornado. Well whatever man. All right well that's this thing. It plays SimCity. Seal of approval!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002452.wav|You're gonna have to place those yourself. And as a result, they're gonna look really, really out of place on your new... sci-fi... lunar... lake... town.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002838.wav|And if *you* enjoy the view behind bars, then you can even make your own jail cells at home, which fits in perfectly with the new basements they recently added. Mmm, torture dungeons have never been so easy!|0
