/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003662.wav|Here's my verdict: if you've never played the previous games, then this is a nice choice. Now's the time to play it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001957.wav|You can also woohoo in the magic box of mystery, but it's not as exciting as having pictures taken while you're in the act. One other bit of awesome is the return of the Genie.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002745.wav|This pack is all about maturing. For one thing, you've got dedicated fart and burp commands now. both of which are skills I developed as a young lad and have continued to hone to this day.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003378.wav|Crap! I can actually use it how it's meant to be, like in one hand... a little bit, so it's...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000567.wav|Weren't there vampires in the Late Night expansion? Yes, questioner of the bovine. You are correct! And if you didn't have Late Night, you'll have them now.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000903.wav|So I'm assuming this will now... So that's how much of a radius we've got to work with. Okay.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003395.wav|Covered some really weird stuff here that just doesn't feel right. But this just hurts! Hurts right here, it hurts right here, and it hurts up here. Like, that's not...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003665.wav|Twitter and Facebook are things. As is Patreon, if you would like to support the goals of this show even further. And thanks to Focus Home Interactive for giving me the opportunity to say their game isn't worth the money.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002318.wav|Yeah, I like owning a business. It's fun when you have money you can... make more money with.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000901.wav|Yeah, again, I don't know how much of this we're actually gonna be able to use, so let's try it and we'll see what it does. All right. Well, that answers that question.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001112.wav|not bad, but it's moving a lot more on the screen than it is in real life, like it's not– I mean, look at that. *pfft* I'm moving like two feet by moving two inches.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002475.wav|Geez, could that get any more ominous?! Imagine you're someone that already had their content taken by these guys.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002427.wav|and it was posted there on February 11th of this final year of humanity's existence, 2012. Now if you've seen my other videos about these store towns, you'll know that I am really not a big fan of them.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003670.wav|Ahh "Hazardous Environments," still one of the best intro themes around. And at this point you get the original Half-Life main menu, something I hadn’t seen in ages.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002993.wav|How we actually get them fishies out of there is by building a fishing harbor to begin with. There's more specialized ones that we'll unlock the more fish you fish.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002453.wav|And of course, the biggest drawback to this is the fact that it costs $25. To me, that is simply not worth what you're getting here. This is just a town.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000018.wav|Now, you only have the option to create one Sim here, that being the Monarch. However, there are many more that you can choose later, you'll just have to unlock them.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000885.wav|I mean, look at that. Yeah, look at me. So this should be pretty much the ideal DiscT@2 medium.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001575.wav|uses a well-known scientific fallacy. An urban myth... misattributed to Albert Einstein and bunch of other people.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002707.wav|This is a preset selection of matches taking you through most of the content in the game, divided up into game types. Starting with Deathmatch, with the other modes unlocking in sequence after you’ve completed enough of the previous ones.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002278.wav|So I've pretty much just accepted that these kinds of packs are not made with players like me in mind that are looking for a more substantial game. And that's fine.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002593.wav|And I've read comments from a subset of Sims fans who were hoping for that kind of fully fledged expansion and take a bit of offense by the chopping up of this content. And, yeah, I can get that notion.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003430.wav|Not only that but you can make a completely custom breed or crossbreed existing ones, making for some truly inspiring combinations. Say hello to the hottest new designer dog, the Greyhound Pug!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001353.wav|And it looks... fine? I dunno, I don’t hate it. I saw this image floating around comparing the new colors to Norton Commander for MS-DOS, and well, when you put it that way I guess I have to approve.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000657.wav|Raking leaves is a thing now, which makes me wonder why mowing lawns isn't a thing during the summer. I mean seriously, they've added leaves and flowers and rainfall, yet grass is still as lifeless as ever.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000768.wav|That said, there's plenty of other stuff to enjoy here. Uh, I mean, look at these freakin' houses. Holy crap, this is cool!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000056.wav|But they're open to the idea, so long as they start seeing some proof that you exist. The more Sims believe in you, the more they'll listen to you, and follow your unseen, possibly masochistic, hand.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000622.wav|So thank Jupiter and Tarhun, The Sims 3 Seasons expansion pack has finally arrived to answer your seasonal prayers. Snowboarding, ball kicking, creeping up on women in bikinis and more.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003358.wav|In fact, that's more comfortable. Maybe I will. Let's try that again but a little bit easier. Let me just go over here.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001709.wav|I got some Altec Lansing speakers that I usually use in this set up over here, but they need power. Plug it into the wall?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001611.wav|(LAUGHS) At least... that is the idea. Whether or not this is actually successful in doing that, well...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001384.wav|Ahhh, yes, such a lovely day. And I've got everything I need, too. Not a desire of mine goes unquenched– Uh, oh! Wait, what the frick is this?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001168.wav|Yeah, suck it tiger, how do you like that? No thanks to the Action Replay. All right, let’s give the original Age of Empires a shot this time, which the Action Replay only provides a single cheat for: unlimited resources.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000118.wav|I've wanted more ways to reliably start fires in The Sims 4 and these things do the trick every time. Street Art is another new thing which makes sense with the urban setting going on.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003322.wav|"More instinctive and realistic gameplay." Really! "Works with Doom and most 3D action games." "Free bonus software," blah blah blah...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003221.wav|Pull back on the control yoke to pitch the nose up and there we go folks, we are now airborne. Please sit back, relax and enjoy the flight.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000847.wav|And the software, which, really, this is all we need since we're using the Windows version here. It also came with some Mac software with a different program for burning stuff, Toast 5.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000077.wav|(laughs) And then there's the ball pit. Aw, man, this thing. Was this modeled and textured in 1997?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000331.wav|There are also around forty new objects in Buy Mode, most of which are kid-oriented. But it's not 100% like the clothing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000780.wav|Otherwise, just wait for a sale or something on Origin, or maybe it'll come out in a store eventually. Either way, definitely check this one out.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000975.wav|There was no Sega Saturn version this time and the announced Panasonic M2 port was canceled, obviously. But yeah, on the PlayStation in particular there were so many other great racing games to choose from.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002120.wav|Basic Asian choices, even! Like, there's no maki sushi, no ramen bowls, no steamed pork buns. It's just conspicuous in its absence, seeing how popular these are.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001967.wav|Hmm, The Sims 4 is still a thing huh? Let’s see, have I missed anything groundbreaking... Bust the Dust kit?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000403.wav|There's also Patreon, which helps keep the show going and... keeps me from stressing out so much, so your support is always appreciated. And thank you very much for watching.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002424.wav|Greetings and welcome to yet another Lazy Game Reviews greetings at the beginning of a video. And welcome to another video!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000299.wav|Stuff is always getting in the way and clipping all over the place, especially when zoomed in. And if you select the icon for one of the passengers, it just snaps the camera all the way back to the starting point instead of focusing on the Sims themselves.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003250.wav|Back when I first got my hands on this, it felt like a program from the future with unfathomable scope and detail, like it was genuinely endless. Even though it genuinely wasn’t.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003388.wav|Uhh... Wow. This is... Don't shoot me! No!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002655.wav|And of course it comes down to whether or not this matches up with your play style. Personally, the more this game mimics real life while staying entertaining, the better. And as such, I think it's pretty awesome.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000863.wav|Let's put some text onto it. So we have a Text Box tool. An Artistic Text tool? Ooh.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000577.wav|However, another element to consider are zombie invasions. Remember that lunar loading screen? Turns out the moon is a big addition to Supernatural, and now you have lunar cycles to keep up with.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002008.wav|Unless you count a stool, a mushroom, and a bale of hay, and in that case there’s a grand total of five. So yeah, that’s the Cottage Living pack.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001018.wav|Laser Rhythmicons that are basically theremins for a futuristic Spencer's Gifts store. And the bountiful chairs, which don't do a single thing different because good God, why the nuts would they? They're freakin' chairs.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002059.wav|Quite often, they'll follow you closer than your own shadow and they're almost always ready to play. When they're not licking your face off, you can find them doing you a favor by digging up your well-manicured lawn.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002075.wav|You can't hunt them for venison or their antlers, and I, I didn't expect you to be able to, but really, what use are deer otherwise? Sure, you can pet them and watch them prance around like ninnies, but that's it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003154.wav|Let's just put the other Musketeer underneath the Musketeer. I totally forgot about all this.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002872.wav|Those things right there, you can click on those or check the video description for links. And there's new videos every Monday and Friday, so subscribing is a thing you can do if you'd like to be notified when there are more of them.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003584.wav|Now, you're not going to be crapping yourself to death from dysentery or anything, but you are going to be running across multiple, less deadly, less smelly challenges. For instance, flat tires.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001735.wav|You press these buttons." See, other than the dip switch table, the manual is pretty useless and boring. However, this is not.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001678.wav|Yeah but, we have here, it doesn't say DC but that's what it is. 12 volt input, six point five amp current, and just connects via your standard four-pin molex connector, to your power supply in your computer.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003608.wav|So even if you crashed 50 times without a seatbelt while starving to death and passing out constantly after being held up at gunpoint, a win is a win. Enjoy your vacation!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002918.wav|Specializations are the game's way of handling natural resources like mineral deposits, crude oil, forestry, and farming. There's no need for giant ploppable buildings to drill for oil.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003666.wav|I’ve been meaning to cover this on LGR for nearly a decade but I’ve continually put it off with it being such an established classic. Well no more excuses, this is Half-Life!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001328.wav|Pffft. Woohoo is so overrated. Say hello to the newest Sims 3 Stuff Pack: Outdoor Living Stuff. Stuff like chairs, hot tubs, refrigerators and things with uselessly curly metal around them.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002586.wav|You can also seek out fellow Vampires and talk to them about Vampire things. Training under them or even sparring with them in a mostly harmless manner.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002029.wav|Have fun with that. And yes, there are even unnatural designs to choose from which is kind of like applying vinyl to your pet. Perhaps a bit cruel in some people's eyes, but you know what?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001116.wav|And I'm not moving it anymore, so, uh, don't have to worry about accidentally screwing things up. Just be like...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001902.wav|It lets you convert your city's map from winter to summer before loading it from the main menu. This *is* better than nothing, but it's no replacement for actual seasons.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003379.wav|it's still not ideal... but it is better than holding it up. Epic Pinball. Let's try this thing out.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002760.wav|Each of those interactions a child makes can be scolded, encouraged, reprimanded, or otherwise commented on by Sims with the Parenting skill. You can pretty much guess how it goes.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003315.wav|So thank you very much, sir. That way I don't have to bend to weird, overinflated eBay prices. But yeah...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001745.wav|Okay, so here's something kind of interesting. It doesn't actually seem to want to tilt.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000069.wav|If you want the whole medieval kingdom-building simulation, there are games out there that do it a whole lot better. Whatever the case, The Sims Medieval really isn't that bad at all, but only if you know what you're getting into.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001478.wav|I'm assuming I'm just gonna have to turn it on and it says I press the little start button to... start it. Right, there's power.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003466.wav|I mean, this game has been out for three years now, is the addition of pets enough to keep it fresh? I don't know.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001938.wav|And lastly, the Singer goes around... singing. What did you expect?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003177.wav|and things like that, wherever I have like an LGR table exhibit thing set up so people can just mess around with all of this, except maybe the cigarette lighter. This thing still scares me.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000660.wav|And by explore, I mean send your Sims inside and trust that they're having fun. Wouldn't these be awesome if they were like the tombs in the World Adventures pack where you could control the Sims wandering around inside?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003333.wav|And, uh... wow. This thing is the cheapest-feeling... accessory that I have felt in a long time.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002021.wav|Actually, that's pretty exciting in comparison, and this loading screen is just sad. But soon I realized I'm even more sad for complaining about a loading screen and the main menu appears in order to pity me.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002063.wav|Otherwise, that 3,000 Simolean sofa might just get downgraded to a love seat once they're through. Lastly, you've got cats.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001079.wav|You know... I wonder if that ever happened.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002081.wav|But this thing... I don't know, something just feels off. For one thing, there's no Sim in sight of it, yet it continues to drive around and spurt its cream all over the place.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002499.wav|Anyway, this is not that! This is a completely different set of executables and releases for both The Sims 1 and 2. There really are a slew of underlying changes here.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000206.wav|If you spend any amount of time looking at my channel, then you will know that I am a huge fan of the Sims series. I loved the first game.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002167.wav|And if you enjoyed this review then do check out my others. I’ve talked about plenty of Sims stuff, and cover a variety of things each week on LGR. And as always thank you very much for watching!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001722.wav|Obviously, they're still around today, but they're no longer making niche devices like this. And, this is about as niche of a device as you can imagine. I mean, it really is made just for pinball games.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000280.wav|But a game not being a total waste of time does not by any means result in it being worth a full $60 or more. Absolutely friggin' not!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002730.wav|Having said that, I also gotta mention the later console ports cuz they weren’t half bad! I was always amused by the fact that both the Sega Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 ports allowed playing with a mouse and keyboard, so that was awesome.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002323.wav|You can also explore cave systems. And by "explore," I mean send your Sim inside and... just don't stop believin' that cool things are happening inside.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001110.wav|Like a magic wand or something at this point. It still sucks. To be honest, you know what would be really good?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001740.wav|Right. This is the game that it was meant to be played with, or at least that it came packed with.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001604.wav|As well as some tips for adjusting... the thing... (LAUGHS) ...if it doesn't work. I love this, too: Like, "why is the performance varying?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001628.wav|I felt like I was more or less controlling it sometimes. It was just... gross. It just didn't taste very good whatsoever.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002037.wav|To pee all over the place. To make noise. To tear apart your house.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002392.wav|to be playing something like this retro, futuristic, post-apocalypse thing on this tiny, little, crappy black and white tube. It just makes sense.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000335.wav|On to the stuff that's exclusive to the chitlins, though, like these two little guys. You would think that the kids would be able to pick them up or cuddle them or talk to them or something, but nope!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000072.wav|And as for the community, Well, all anyone seems to be asking my opinion on these days is the upcoming Cats &amp; Dogs pack, with no mention of Toddler Stuff. Even Ralph can't be bothered.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002595.wav|You know, you could probably sum up each of the previous Sims 3 expansion packs with one word, if you really try. Puzzles.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003538.wav|Some wall art, floor coverings, and lights. Including citronella candles to stave off the non-existant Sim Zika virus, and these decorative doo-hickies that stick in the dirt.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002490.wav|I approve of them. I mean, I made them. Not exactly the most impartial, but hey.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003624.wav|Those are still good to use too, but I really like water vehicles. And something else to make use of all that open space with water is awesome, in my book. Same goes for monorails.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001265.wav|Okay, before I talk about anything about this game, I have to to point out my problem with a large majority of Facebook games. I'm talking about a lot of the Zynga and Playfish-style games.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001208.wav|the way they’re introduced one by one is just awesome. Like, the first time a Skaarj shows up? Fantastic!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001474.wav|And then you've got your AV In stuff here. And also S-Video, which is nice. But that's where you plug in the actual power source to the wall.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002293.wav|Yeah, that stuff is cheesy and dumb, but I still like it. The problem for me is that other than the month of October, I don't exactly keep this stuff around in my house and... I don't in my Sims game either.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000773.wav|And I approve! And yeah, you can even do it when the car is just a completely rusted out piece of junk, so you can get tetanus along with your crabs. This is just great. They thought of everything.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001309.wav|Did someone at Maxis fall asleep on the job? Alright. There's also one ceiling light, one refrigerator, one stove with an optional range hood, and one ice cream maker.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002210.wav|And with fire, just place a buncha fire stations and bulldoze whatever’s touching fire tiles, because fire can’t spread over blank land. Oh yeah, land, that’s a thing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000369.wav|eventually. After several hours, I still found myself struggling a lot... but I was at least getting used to panning by holding down this button, moving that one, and getting used to the dead zone...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002067.wav|And, yes, they also have a scratching need to fulfill, so make sure they have a scratching post so they don't use your leg instead. But their main ability is that they can hunt other animals.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003545.wav|Anything that adds a soothing atmosphere and overall chill vibe to the Sims is awesome in my book. Like the return of waterslides.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001294.wav|So please remember who's house you're in and don't woohoo your mom by accident. What I do like about this game is its simplicity and its sense of progression.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002365.wav|I could see this thing being useful for, um... Well, actually, a lot of things, this isn't actually the worst idea in the world, it just needs some better way to attach, for one thing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000602.wav|In fact, werewolves can't do much of anything special at all. I mean, sure, you can run around trying to bite people and turning them into werewolves, but what's the point?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002766.wav|Kind of a neat idea, I suppose, but it's about the least engaging way to alter a kid's character values. It's pretty hands off.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001121.wav|It's just kind of... neat. Like, it's a novelty. Yeah! Slow motion for no reason!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001496.wav|Yeah, Crashbreaker! Oh, yeah...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000865.wav|Let's see. Yeah, it just sorta wraps around the CD. Then you can do that.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001811.wav|Some of the most time-consuming options come in the form of two new skills: Research &amp; Debate and Robotics. Research &amp; Debate is uh -- well, it’s that!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002312.wav|Go right ahead. Wanna make it ridiculous, creating a barge filled with nothing but chairs? Feel free, sitting fanatic.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001078.wav|You know, it's like: Who bought this game for you? Mom? Dad? Brother, sister, grandparent? Or maybe you! Maybe you actually bought your own thing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001514.wav|Obviously that have changed that I've been on look out for this ever since doing that video. And when I finally got one, completely boxed and a good price, this is just like the real thing, according to PC GAMER.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000427.wav|See here's the thing, I think you're in a simulation. Riiiight. I mean, I guess that would kind of make sense.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002639.wav|Yeah, dude, you haven't seen life for all it is until you've at least tried Buzzberry, Bumbleleaf and Wonderpetals, man. Also, dumpster diving, because waste not, want not.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001599.wav|Yeah, so we just plug that in right there... RJ-11 right there... AC adapter here, so basically this plugs into the wall, of course...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001844.wav|And I thought this was pretty neat as well until I realized it is once again pretty random. Much like bowling scores in the Sims 4 Bowling Stuff pack, your climb times aren't something you can do much about directly.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003341.wav|So, I don't know, I guess they couldn't find them for that. Why? Why just the cheat codes? My guess is because that playing the game with this gun is so bad, that the only way that you can actually play...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002471.wav|Apparently, all of this never got anywhere, but the community was pretty livid at the time and bringing it up to the right people still brings about rage. Talk about an appropriate name for this product, too.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001479.wav|Okay, wow. There we go. Yeah! Uh, here's what I'm seeing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001958.wav|This is in the form of a lifetime reward that you can get which of course produces a genie that grants you three wishes. Although mine seemed to be more interested in playing golf and hitting on random women.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000167.wav|All of these need to be met or you'll have one seriously depressed Sim in no time. Sims have their own free will, of course, so they'll do things like eat, sleep and pee on the floor all by themselves.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002431.wav|So, many huge thanks to you, individual who I assume enjoys what I do, because now I am doing this. See what you've done?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000983.wav|At least until The Sims 4 comes out and kills us ALL under the sheer weight of its no doubt dozen-plus expansions. So don't get too sad, I'm not going anywhere.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000478.wav|And after both episodes are complete, all you get is a snarky message saying you deserve a glass of punch and some cake. But since those aren’t available, welp, game over.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002175.wav|That being said though, the older I got, the more SimCity I played, and the deeper I dove into what made the simulation tick? That’s when I started to truly appreciate what SimCity was all about, and why the software was developed in the first place.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001627.wav|So, I tried it with my tongue... after cleaning it, of course, since my toe was just in there. And this actually seemed to work a tiny little bit.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001491.wav|You know, honestly, I'm not noticing any input lag, like going through the menus and stuff. No, that's like, that's dead on.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002973.wav|You can also check LGR stuff on Twitter, Facebook, Patreon, and your local High Street store. Maybe not the last one. But that's okay.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001585.wav|write using thing, but that never happened. This thing can only detect direction... and intensity of a direction.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000298.wav|You can either ride alone or toss a couple passengers in the middle, and waft around the unimpressive-looking canals. Not only does the water kind of look painted on, but the camera can be a huge pain to work with.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003297.wav|But you can at least find and interact with them when you come across them, and even become one temporarily by way of blessings and curses. Remember those relics I mentioned earlier?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001501.wav|Yeah, maybe better as just a camera viewfinder for looking at footage really quick and maybe not so much as, like, your personal movie theater. 'Cause for one thing, it really just doesn't look like that massive of a screen. It looks nice.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003425.wav|Fresh print owns. So would I recommend Fast Lane Stuff? Well, as always, the suggested price by EA is $20, so it's a toss-up.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001120.wav|I mean, the thing only cost thirty bucks when it was new, so obviously, the build quality isn't huge or anything. But, man.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003190.wav|Hehe. Guess it was HARD not to make that reference, a chance like that only COMES around so often, glad they didn’t COCK it up. Sex.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002042.wav|That crap's just sad and it bums everyone out in the household, including other pets, so don't do it! Pets can also have relationships with other pets, including having their own friends and enemies.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000879.wav|That's like 20 times more visible than the tattoo is. So I was looking through some old reviews about the DiscT@2ing system and that was one of the primary complaints.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000871.wav|So you can hit the preview and there's kinda what you might get. Yeah, okay. We'll see.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000669.wav|I love how the Sims leave tracks in the snow when they're walking around in it. I love how icicles hang off the edge of buildings and the windows fog up inside. Can you tell I really frickin' like this season?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003536.wav|A place that feels mighty appropriate for things like the new hair and clothing. Of which there are a handful of summer-y looking articles for men, women, and children and everyone in between.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000177.wav|You just run out of things to do so quickly and the scope is super limited, even with expansions. And their motives diminish so quickly that it makes it more of a chore than anything.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003381.wav|And then we got the... this I think is the left flipper... I'm not sure... yeah, it is. And then the other side button is the right flipper.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002104.wav|Although one way to make even the worst waiter stand out is to dress them up in a hot dog suit. I think we can all agree there.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001623.wav|I thought maybe another finger would help. I was doing it on my index finger on my left hand. The manual says to try another hand with the middle fingers.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002645.wav|And do it again the next night! And the next. And the next, because University is your orchard, and the fruit is ripe for the picking.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001923.wav|I suppose that you could argue that minimalist approach is aesthetically appealing to a higher intellectual state. But you can also argue that it's just lame.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002950.wav|Now, what is this? What does it include? Is it worth it? Well that's exactly why I'm making this video.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002841.wav|You can also respect the chemistry by using the chemistry table, a long-standing tradition in Sims games by this point. You probably know the drill.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002073.wav|They fit just fine. Although, sometimes they'll escape from your pocket, and in that case, you'll want to find them before a dog does and sees it as a tasty meal. Also, birds and cats don't mix.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003728.wav|But you will be draining your wallet if you want to get very far very quickly. Why?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000582.wav|And obviously the most notable difference from normal Sims is the fact that they've got magical freaking wings. On their back.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002743.wav|Well, parenting, and hoods, I guess. Maybe not hoods, just parenting. And all the trials and tribulations that befall anyone who seeks such a fate.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000555.wav|"Embrace the Supernatural" with just about every horror story cliche imaginable, yet with that trademark Sims twist. This is not the expansion droid I'm looking for.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001123.wav|Because Doom and pool cues have a bit of history, if you ask Tom Cruise especially. So, yes, let's give the new Doom a try.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002843.wav|Like the cloning device, so you'll never have to be alone again. But yeah, remember the rumors about aliens earlier? They weren't just rumors.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003125.wav|And here's one that I actually haven't covered yet, and this is the Veris, uh, what is this? It's the Antec Veris, yeah, Multimedia Station Premier.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000988.wav|Doe'n't matter what you pick because before long, some crazy crap will start happening right in front of your vision organs. It's a portal of mystery, a mysterious portal, a gateway to another time!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001518.wav|So what the freak is this thing? Well, this is made by Thrustmaster, The same people that were responsible for doing a whole ton of stuff, mainly joysticks. Like the excellent F-16 flight stick.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002016.wav|Canus lupus? Equus Ferus? Homenum Revelio– wait, what?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002924.wav|Not to mention naming things is basically pointless, since there's no way to track them after you lose line-of-sight. Basically, it's a little easy to feel left out of the loop when it comes to information, and that's one of my chief complaints about the game.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002749.wav|So let's start with the offspring side of things and... ♫ Come out and play! ("Come Out and Play" by The Offspring) Wait, wait, wait, what?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002423.wav|And in that case, you should go and take care of those pressing responsibilities first, by all means. Either way, though, as always, thank you for watching.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003417.wav|There's a little bit of Intrigue and Luxury in there, too. All are appropriate clothing and headwear that you'll find to match the styles that came with the Stuff Pack. One final addition to Fast Lane Stuff is a very odd one.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000007.wav|There may be mods someday, but as of now, they're incompatible. Is there a console version? NOPE!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001979.wav|And in this pack, the way it works is you simply buy a coop and order some birds, either chicks or fully-grown. And then care for them as hands-on or hands-off as you like.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001102.wav|I'm trying to aim here. I'm not even sure– What am I playing, nine ball? Aw... Well, we're gonna fail at this.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000222.wav|However, what's really disappointing is when you realize that you can no longer customize the clothing and accessories however you want. The feature known as Create A Style from The Sims 3 is gone.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000744.wav|Recycling, composting, plant-based diets, planting shrubs, none of those things affect their footprint. But using eco-friendly wall patterns, now that reduces smog!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001172.wav|Okay, one more game here even though I don’t have much hope for it: Forsaken. Again it comes with cheats for unlimited things like ammo and time. Again, it doesn’t work whatsoever.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001743.wav|Okay, well... What do ya know? These flippers actually feel really good.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003022.wav|It looks neat, it's fun to play with, and it's also free with the latest patch for City Skylines, so you don't even need this pack to get them. Good stuff!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002483.wav|And when it IS running, it'll go from being smooth as silk to choppier than a choppy ocean full of chopsticks in no time at all. Plain and simple, That's Life 2 is a pile of crap.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002023.wav|Whoops. Gave away my secret. So, yeah, Appaloosa Plains.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001964.wav|You can only send or receive one Sim at a time through SimPort, so groups are out of the question entirely. They can't even get up on stage with your singer.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000990.wav|And being that his name is "time traveler" spelled backwards, of course you're going to go with him because that stuff is legit! But first you have to collect some stupid... glowing tubes from your yard...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002551.wav|Even if it's as basic as this. Like maybe a borderless windowed mode, some Steam Cloud saves. You don't get that.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002047.wav|Or if you have the PC limited edition, you also have the pet store to help deal with your animal needs. This is a lot that you can place anywhere and acts like any other walk-in lot.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002779.wav|Doesn't this seems like a kind of a perfect pack for bunk beds? I dunno, I just like bunk beds, I guess. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this video.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001605.wav|The reason is simple: YOU!" It's your fault. Not the product.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000016.wav|Things like being a compulsive gambler, an insomniac or a drunkard. Yes, there is alcohol in the game. Friggin' finally.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000009.wav|Yeah, it's both and neither at the same time. It has role-playing elements, but it also has Sims elements.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000845.wav|It's other capabilities? That's not why it's on "Oddware" here because, uh, the other stuff is pretty great, not odd at all. It's got a lotta great specs. Which I'm not interested in!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000422.wav|Hello! Hey can we talk? Okay.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001879.wav|*laughs* Well, unlike previous 20 dollar stuff packs, this one retails at 30 friggin’ dollars! Yes, you heard me, and I thought it was a joke at first too.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002951.wav|Because you have no other way of figuring that stuff out whatsoever. It's not like you're on the Internet. Or maybe you just enjoy hearing me ramble on about Sims things.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001618.wav|or if the wormy thing just does wormy things on its own... and sort of makes me FEEL like I'm actually controlling it with my mind. In fact, turning around and not looking at the screen at all...|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003602.wav|Unfortunately, you don't get any music. Not really anyway.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001437.wav|Dang. And that’s The Sims 4 StrangerVille! It costs twenty dollars and the majority of its content consists of a linear storyline, quite a departure from the usual fare.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001529.wav|There were so many PC pinball games back then. It was ridiculous. So I guess it make scene that, you know, it would enough of a niche market to make this. But, it still just so odd to me.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003155.wav|Everything about this is gonna scream fire hazard by the time I'm done. Both the Cooler Master things are like totally different silvers, how annoying is that?|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000565.wav|You also get some new traits, like Night Owl, Supernatural Skeptic, and Supernatural Fan. And no, that has nothing to do with whether or not you like Sam and Dean Winchester.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003127.wav|See my video for in-depth demonstration of this, and many of these others is not really gonna be going into detail of any of these. We're just gonna get 'em in there and make this tower look amazing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003424.wav|It's not very open-ended. Now that's fine if you want that, but I don't know that I did. I'll probably just stick to custom content cars myself, since they're free and they look a lot better than these anyways.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000234.wav|You can also use the Shift and bracket keys together to scale items. Infinitely. It's ridiculous and seems kinda like a glitch, but I don't care.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000454.wav|Plus two weird tools at your disposal, which don’t seem to do much of anything useful at first. Yeah, if you haven’t played the original Ducks, then what you need to do is absolutely unclear at the beginning.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000695.wav|But a $40 expansion? Eh, let’s give it the benefit of the doubt for the moment and see what we’ve got. Beginning with what the HECK is this?!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000508.wav|So yeah, load up on goats and sheep at your own risk. It may bring about the end of all free will. Lastly there are a few activities and destinations worth mentioning.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001185.wav|It's pretty much all focused on retro tech and computers and games and stuff, so if that's your thing then you're in the right place. Regardless though, thank you very much for watching LGR!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000010.wav|That would be... depending on whether or not it's European or African.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000033.wav|These magically-inclined Sims are born with the ability to use spells and craft magic items. Basically, they shoot glowy stuff from sticks at Sims you don't like, so they're awesome.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001090.wav|And a computer desk. Let's try this out. Okay, so I've got the Pool Shark plugged in here on my main Windows 98 machine I do a lot of capturing on.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001388.wav|With tanks of NOS and razor blades and scalp wax. D20s...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001556.wav|That's neat. But it does tilt, you know, pretty easily, so... OK, gonna try with one more game here. This is Balls of Steel.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002275.wav|LGR: And yeah, that's pretty much it for this pack. It costs 10 bucks as usual, and I guess you could say I'm not a fan, 'cause I'm not.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003232.wav|This mode here is where it’s at. Or how about a bare-knuckled landing attempt on a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier? Yeah, look no further, these flight modes have gotcha covered.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001350.wav|Not long enough in my opinion. Or Ralph’s, who uh, yeah. I almost forgot that happened.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000928.wav|For like an hour anyway. I soon got over it and enjoyed Need For Speed II for what it was. Besides, how can you hate a game that lets you race as a T-Rex through the Australian Outback?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002439.wav|So, it would have been kind of cool if they went all out and made futuristic moon cars or something to have on here. I guess we'll leave that up to modders.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003694.wav|Maps also weave together in a way that was fresh at the time, where one area loads directly into the next as you encounter it. No key cards, exit switches, or level ending stat screens here.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001066.wav|We'll take a look at those in a second. But let's just go ahead and take a look at the Pool Shark cue thing itself. Um... All right.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003170.wav|I want a lot of these things to work that aren't currently functioning. And on that note, I think I'm gonna end this video here, even though I really don't want to.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001468.wav|Heart disease, high blood pressure, nope! Seizures, might cause those. It might also cause eye fatigue, eye damage or loss of your visual functions.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001352.wav|They changed the plumbob! Aw dang and like, everything else too. Menus, icons, everything.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002216.wav|Placing zones is like planting seeds, power and transportation is like fertilizer and watering, disasters and broken infrastructure is like pestilence and weeds. SimCity is a garden of pixelated people.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000796.wav|Especially with the inevitable "Seasons" expansion. This pack also provides what I assume must be the true intent of the Town of Newcrest: giant hot tubs. It's obvious, isn't it?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001357.wav|So let’s talk about The Sims 4 Mosquito Stuff or whatever. This is a pack of stuff with things in it. Things like clothes and accessories, as you’d expect for a pack branded by a company that primarily sells clothing and accessories.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003644.wav|Full disclosure here: while I've not been paid to do this video, I was sent a copy of the game by the company. That being said, Cities XXL is a freakin' ripoff.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002989.wav|But it will work on any existing map, as long as it has waterways. Meaning that the new desert map, Desert Oasis, is going to be a challenge for this water-centric content.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003645.wav|Except it's also not, and is arguably the best one in the series. Which I know makes no sense, but bear with me for a moment.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000819.wav|There are also a slew of buildings, objects and services that can help predict and prevent disasters and rebuild afterward if the need arises. For instance, it is not only YOU that can prevent forest fires.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000996.wav|So that can be a hassle, I guess. But still it just makes you dirtier, no big deal.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001629.wav|And why stop there? Why should humans have all the fun? So I got this cherry tomato straight out of the refrigerator...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002078.wav|Jump right in and get some! However, I have one small issue with this: have you ever jumped into a bale of hay, much less got your freak on in one? That crap hurts!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003350.wav|You know, I can see why they would say it's a little expensive. For something with a keyboard key. As a thumb stick.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001566.wav|That's right! I wanna beat this level!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001080.wav|Because as fas as I could tell, this company was not around very long. Interact was around a while longer, but, uh... Mana-whatever-com, uh, comet, Miacomet? They just kinda shut down.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003246.wav|This mode let you customize your own prop plane, glider, or fixed-wing tactical jet, including performance, components, and paint jobs. Man, I went completely nuts when I discovered this!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000000.wav|So there's The Sims 3 and a small army of expansions and Stuff packs available for it. Just like all the other Sims games. But then The Sims Medieval comes out and...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001969.wav|Country Kitchen kit, no. Courtyard Oasis, nope. Throwback Fit, uh-uh.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001115.wav|Heh heh. That's what he said. Man, that works so much better, just flicking it. Come on!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001114.wav|Yeah! Oh, that was way better. Just flick it with your finger.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003124.wav|In fact a lot of these look like they could go on a car but they don't, they're 5 1/4 inch drive bay things. And yeah this is, uh. Looks great, had to have it!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003404.wav|What you need is The Sims 3 Fast Lane Stuff the newest Stuff Pack expansion for The Sims 3. At least, you do according to EA and The Sims Team.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001127.wav|Come on! It doesn't really want to do this.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003600.wav|Like, there's not even a steering wheel. There are no curves or turns anywhere. Yet there are still enough irregularities that it makes every scenario feel unique.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001753.wav|I'm obviously not paying attention to what I'm doing because this is a-- a really sucky game going on here. The tilt still doesn't seem to want to really work.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001054.wav|And during Christmas, it's just that much better. Completely superb puzzle games for DOS and the Amiga can be few and far between.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001910.wav|And if you enjoyed this video on Skylines: Snowfall-- Man, that sounds like a James Bond movie, doesn't it? Anyway...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002303.wav|Island Paradise begins with a blue screen of loading, which is fine since at least it's not a blue screen of death. Unless your death comes from drowning in the ocean, and in that case... dang it, blue screen of death it is.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002066.wav|They like their silly little toys like yarn, wall things and fake mice. Especially catnip-filled mice. Nothing like having a stoned cat roaming around the house scratching everything.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001539.wav|And yeah, this is literally a simple, a whole manage is. You just slide under there, and there you go. You also put it on the other side.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000209.wav|And then The Sims 3 came out in 2009, and it was yet another good iteration to the series. It had its problems, of course, but it was also something that kept the same formula but just improved and added onto.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001644.wav|and somehow that's YOU being the problem. And can you imagine... if something like this actually HAD caught on, though?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001650.wav|So, it kind of negates the majority of the entire point of this device... since you don't control it with your mind but the mouse. You choose your color and brush and then point at the direction...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001299.wav|And if you're willing to keep coming back to it, beg your friends for help and hand over your hard-earned cash, then by all means, who am I to stop you? But as for me, no freakin' thank you!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000676.wav|And I mean they're getting free junk and hot drinks, so I guess I can't blame them. This activity is not really that involved though. I mean, you can't choose what gifts everyone gets, but it's still cool to watch.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002398.wav|There were, uh, you know color versions of these in much later camcorders and such. But you know what? This, this'll do for now.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003034.wav|You get trolley buses instead of trams, and helicopters instead of blimps. Small planes instead of only jetliners.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003356.wav|Uh... I mean, seriously.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001463.wav|And there's an LCD behind each one. It's a .55-inch LCD. You got two of those. And you know, it does look like you should be able to see through them, or maybe toggle something in front to be able to see through, but nope.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001726.wav|The actual device itself is pretty straightforward. Where, you know, you got this *really* neat-looking Virtual Pinball logo on there. I actually quite like that logo.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002079.wav|Each piece of hay is like a freaking razor blade with a sharp point if it's in the right shape and you bump into it the wrong way. I ain't gettin' my junk nowhere near that junk!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002308.wav|So get your towels ready. It's about to go down. Err, actually, try to stay afloat instead using anything from rowboats to paddle boats to jet skis to sailboats to speedboats.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002966.wav|For me at least, there's a bug that results in my not being able to actually restock the display cases for Sims to buy things. And that's kind of a huge deal.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000338.wav|Kids can also use this self-contained puppet theater, both to entertain themselves and entertain anyone who's willing to sit down and watch. Just don't zoom inside of the thing while they're acting out their plays.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000558.wav|Full moon. After the loading screen finishes mooning you, you're taken to the the moon menu– er, main menu... to select an old game or start a new one.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002335.wav|And by all means, enjoy that down time because, hey, it's a tropical island. That basically gives you a free-for-all license to be a creeper.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000443.wav|Something a buncha retro YouTubers are doing this month cuz I dunno, why not, DOS is fun. Check out the playlist in the video description for more. As for this video, yeah, Xmas Ducks 2000!|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002963.wav|It's not just limited to baked goods. If you wanna make a shop that specializes in hot dogs and cheese blocks run by one of Duke Nukem's Merry Weiner Wenches, go for it!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000371.wav|I'm not diving into the actual gameplay because they've already talked about that, but yeah Sims 4 on consoles. (Strange noises) It's fine.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002012.wav|And if you enjoyed this pack review, sweet! I don’t plan on covering many more of them at this point, and instead I’ll only do the full expansion packs when it comes to The Sims 4.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001557.wav|And it actually mapped to the keyboard control and doesn't support, like joystick or... whatever. This is... So, let's try this out.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001229.wav|Most of the time you’re just picking up medkits and such off the ground, but every so often you’ll see a seed which can activated by planting it and waiting for it to grow. Seriously.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000872.wav|And at this point it's just the same as burning any other disc, so, I don't know, we don't need to put much on here. Let's just put those pictures that we were looking through.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003531.wav|What the-- weren't we here just like a couple weeks ago? Is it really time for another one of these?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000398.wav|It's got interesting stuff, but I don't know that I would have gotten it if this wasn't my job. But the non-reviewer lifestyle is so far behind me now, I don't even remember what that was like.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002300.wav|Way too much muchness, you know? So you make a hot dog, thinking that will suffice, but no, it's just not enough. What you need is a change of pace.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001871.wav|I admit that I am definitely not the target demographic for this pack, but who is?! The Candy man?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003152.wav|Look at that, that's the mirror is so stupid. All right, let's do the ridiculous air conditioner.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002155.wav|Like turning down a friend’s offer to hang out so I can stay at home checking the comments section and studying trending video topics in the dark. Am I talking about the game or real life, beats me I’m a mess, send help!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001030.wav|Did you enjoy something about this video? Well I've got plenty more on The Sims 3 and a bunch of other stuff, too. Click one of these video clips and it'll take you to 'em.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000284.wav|Yes, base games always have less than a fully-expanded game of the past, and that's fine. but they've never taken out this many core features from the previous game, either.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000620.wav|It's packed to the brim full of very well-made content, and that's how an expansion *should* be. Well, if you're into this kind of expansion.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001600.wav|this'll plug into the serial port on your computer... and this slips onto one of your fingers. Also got the "User's Manual" which is pretty informative and...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002552.wav|You don't get achievements, you don't get custom UI scaling. You're just stuck with whatever it gives you. And you don't get anything other than the PC release.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001624.wav|I figured, why not the MOST middle of middle fingers: and, well, what do you know? I... once again cannot tell the difference...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002710.wav|I didn’t much like it twenty years ago and I certainly don’t have much patience for it now, but anyway! Once you do complete everything else it’s onto the final final challenge: Xan Kriegor.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003273.wav|Sometimes both, like how you can dress up in Sims 4 llama costumes in Final Fantasy XV now. Mmkay.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002519.wav|So I thought, okay what about in-between, taking it up to 2560x1440? Oh and by the way, the OS scaling doesn't make a difference for me at all. It really just depends on the native resolution here.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003618.wav|But really, the biggest draw of this DLC pack are the different transportation types. Let's start with the cable cars, which is a welcome new pedestrian transport option.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002547.wav|It's mostly the crashes for me. I just can't get fully immersed in the games when they're crashing so often. And again the originals, they're crashy buggy glitch fests as well.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000781.wav|And screw YouTube's stupid policies right now because I'm really wary of this video getting flagged for copyright crap. But you know what?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002562.wav|But color me surprised that the one feature so many Simmers have requested for over two years is here at no charge. Not only that, but it's GOOD!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001450.wav|Yeah I dunno, it’s The Sims, these things happen. And yep, once again that is The Sims 4 StrangerVille. I had a couple hours of fun while it lasted, but beyond that?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002024.wav|Less of this, more of this. It's filled with ranches and cowboy hats and seems to be stuck in a perpetual autumn-like season.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000065.wav|It at least comes with a manual inside, even though it's pretty thin. The in-game tutorial is really where you'll get your information while playing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001290.wav|Nope! The game is about as social as receiving an email that looks like spam but it has your friend's name on it, so you open it anyways. You know that row of neighbors on the bottom of the screen?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002598.wav|And now: streaking. Aw, yeah, it's about friggin' time!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001664.wav|as well as get some perks, like being able to view episodes earlier than anywhere else. And as always, you are controlling my mind... to tell you thank you for watching.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001039.wav|You accomplish this by giving each Lemming an appropriate skill at an appropriate time. You will want to use a mouse for this because often a split second can make all the difference, and using a joystick is an absolute pain.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001230.wav|You’ll find these out in the world too, already grown. But when you plant one the longer you wait, the more health you’ll get from the plant, up to 30 health points. It’s weird and inconvenient, but that’s neat.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000876.wav|This is terrible! You can't see the image beneath it, like, at all, can you? I can't.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002518.wav|For the original Sims, it's perfectly fine in my opinion. Plus, the UI is more as it should be, and this is pretty ideal. But I wasn't really fully satisfied with this either.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000832.wav|I mean, just take one look at that '@' sign in the name there and, yeah, 2002 indeed. Now overall, this really is just a CD-RW.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001714.wav|It is delightfully odd, what more can you ask for on this show? So I hope that you enjoyed seeing it come together as much as I enjoyed screwin' around with it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001517.wav|They came packaged with a gamed called "Royal Flush". And it had a box that look actually a bit like a pinball machine. And that is even cooler than this.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001610.wav|it detects that there's something there... and then tries to read your signals. And, in turn, your mind.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003316.wav|This is, of course, the Demon Gunn. And it's made by a company called TAC Systems, Inc. Now if that sounds familiar to you then...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002428.wav|I felt frickin' ripped off by Barnacle Bay and Hidden Springs. Not because they were necessarily bad towns – although Barnacle Bay kind of was – but because they were so freakin' expensive.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001122.wav|Right, so I was gonna try a pinball game or something with this and, well, I just couldn't find any that worked with the mouse because this is all mouse controls. It doesn't set any keyboard or joystick commands.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002299.wav|...with grass... It's all way too routine. Way too action-packed.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002376.wav|So you might be thinking to yourself, "Why?! What's the point?" Well, there is no point! And that's the point.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001489.wav|Like, if I were to sort of cover up what's around me, I might be able to lose myself in that, but no. It's basically like I'm just looking at a tiny little LCD in front of my face.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002859.wav|Finally, as hinted at in the Detective career, photography makes a comeback, and it does so with a vengeance. Not only can you take pictures with your camera phone, but you can also take more involved selfies.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002509.wav|Combined with the other changes needing the newer operating system and processor, more RAM and all that. But about the only thing here that is blatantly wrong is the hard drive space.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002597.wav|Cocaine. Wub-wub-wub. Hypothermia.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001998.wav|Uh-huh. So wait, if cows can produce plant milk then what do cow plants -- y’know whatever, I don’t wanna know. And with llamas, well they produce wool.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002590.wav|Even if it's a character that sucks necks and has a garlic phobia. What it comes down to with The Sims 4: Vampires game pack is that it's a $20 add-on that I'll rarely visit after this video.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000748.wav|under the Towns section. Though they call it a "world." But technically, it's not a world, it's a town. A "world" would be much larger.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003325.wav|You mighta heard of that one. But "Decent?" Mmm. I heard it's pretty okay. Around the back here, I don't even know what's on the back.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003097.wav|Really, other than the yarn baskets, the most notable new additions are the rocking chairs, of which there are four. Or well, two, one with arms and one without, and each with a pillowed variant.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000751.wav|And that is attire that... can be worn anywhere Not just the boardwalk. Or under the boardwalk.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001818.wav|Though, do be careful around the new shower woohoo location cuz uh, water and servos don’t mix. And calling a repairman for your sex robot is not a good look.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003103.wav|What an absolute non-starter of a stuff pack. Not that any of them are particularly great, but this one is just... I don’t get it, not for ten dollars anyway.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001317.wav|That just makes your sim moan and get fat. Clothing?! That's nice, but you could have included that with any pack.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002902.wav|As a SimCity player since the 1989 original, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this thing. Paradox sent me an early review copy that I've spent about 40 hours on so far.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003320.wav|send faxes over the Internet for free. Oh, man! Apparently that was their most lucrative thing but...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003312.wav|Destroyer Gunn-na-na. "Armament for the 21st Century." Bwwww... Well, this is "gunna" be fun!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003547.wav|(sound of Sim hitting the waterslide hard) And yeah, these milkshakes really do bring all the Sims to the yard. In fact, you can invite the whole friggin' neighborhood over if you'd like.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003630.wav|But for all of this stuff that it adds in the paid-for pack itself, the free update that launched alongside Mass Transit is arguably more awesome. Or at least, I've gotten more enjoyment and use out of it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001323.wav|It's just another forgettable stuff pack and what is sure to be an endless parade of them in the future and frankly, I don't care enough to be offended anymore. Oh, but Ralph.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003342.wav|and do it with this gun... is if you're cheating. But... you know...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002789.wav|They did what any sensible programmers would do: they started putting these little guys in various landscapes full of traps, smashing them up in increasingly brutal ways. They did later develop Grand Theft Auto, after all.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002296.wav|Ha, did you think I forgot Ralph? Nope. Sorry buddy, but this fourth Stuff Pack means you lose your fourth body part. I hope you weren't too attached to that leg.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001961.wav|Well as usual, the suggested price for the normal expansion is $40 and the Collector's Edition is $50. Whether or not it's actually worth that kind of money is kind of a toss-up to me.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002440.wav|But otherwise, this look is apparent in everything, and... I like it, as far as aesthetics go. The house designs in particular are fantastic.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001761.wav|Gotta aim! Ooh!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000539.wav|And it doesn't stop there. You also have varsity sports that have been added to this pack. You got basketball and baseball, swimming, track and field, and American football.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001955.wav|Another new music object is the jukebox, and it's about freakin' time! Because I've been wanting a proper jukebox since the Fast Lane Stuff Pack.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002413.wav|Anyone can sit down and have fun with this immediately and that is an accomplishment. I would, however, like to at least have the option for some sliders here, just to know what can and can't be pulled into shape.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002386.wav|And, of course, I'm going to be showing it off just a little bit more. And, yeah, I know it sort of negates the whole purpose of having a really tiny display, but trust me, after about five seconds, you get eye strain. So, screw it!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000633.wav|But Sims don't like to get soaking wet, so having an umbrella is definitely a good idea. It's not like they'll melt or anything, but they will complain.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002653.wav|Being a plant also makes things a bit odd when they give flowers to each other, since that seems kind of like the equivalent of giving another human being a finger or an earlobe or something. Freakin' freaks!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002848.wav|It also makes it really hard to know who's actually human and who's not when just meeting people. Half the time, you could fall in love with someone and... they'll turn out to be an alien.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003000.wav|One being the Fish Market where the raw food material can be sold directly to citizens and tourists, and it gives the surrounding area a nice health benefit for some reason. And also, some entertainment.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001915.wav|As we approach the third year of The Sims 3's existence, a total of five full expansion packs have been released for the game so far. And out of those, my favorite has probably been Late Night.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001636.wav|It actually sorta started to work. A little bit. But then the other 75% of the time, it was just all over the place...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001363.wav|There’s a new standing bookshelf with several spots to place some of the new clutter objects like books and camera lenses. Joining the storage situation is an angular object display stand that stands there displaying objects.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001012.wav|Honestly, the clothing disappoints me for two reasons. One: it's just ugly. It looks like a spastic mix between Original Series Star Trek and The Hunger Games. And two: where's my Road Warrior attire?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000760.wav|And just completely disregarding the price, this aesthetically is 100 percent entirely worth it. I'm just gonna go ahead and say it up front just because of the look of this place. I love it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001264.wav|And if you dug what you just saw then awesome! This went a lot longer than I planned but whatever, this game is rad.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001499.wav|I'm already feeling the eye strain, though. That's weird! Like, just being so used to modern VR stuff. Oh, that feels so much better already.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001072.wav|Not a mouse wheel, you know, that would go up and down. It goes horizontally here. And that's because of one more thing that is really the crux of this whole device.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003148.wav|Really, this is just using plus five volts, but also it wants to stand by. I mean I guess we don't really have to do that, we could just plug it in whatever way, but let's just put it in the pass-through.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001608.wav|But, yeah, it's actually really cheap. Comes apart super easily. And underneath, you have all of this wonderful... little bits of integrated circuitry and whatnot.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000035.wav|They pretty much go around blessing and cursing Sims, depending on how you're feeling. Ah, there's nothing like a little religious oppression to start the day off right. And finally, you have the Spy.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001521.wav|So these are the controllers themselves, um... Pretty basic, very flimsy, plasticly kind of things, with crappy buttons. They're really, really filmsy.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001785.wav|Or at the computer or on their phone, but yeah, the mailbox is the most straightforward option. What’s not so straightforward is actually being accepted into the higher educational program of your choosing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003625.wav|I absolutely love monorails! I love them in the game, I love them in real life. I love them in my dreams at night.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002057.wav|A horse with demon powers, since it may just set the world on fire when you aren't looking. It also has the ability to bless Sims– that is, if it's not feeling like freakin' Satan at the time.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001833.wav|Yeah, I thought so. Well, thanks yet again to the folks at Maxis for sending me a review code for this pack. Because, man, I did not want to pay the $10 asking price for this one.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002727.wav|WITH A ZERO. Ah yes. I swear I downloaded like, every single map Cliff recommended here. And I don’t recall ever being disappointed either, it was good stuff!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001429.wav|And that card can be used to waltz deep into the bowels of The Lab, the answers you seek surely just within reach. What lies beyond that door?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003626.wav|They're neat and I like the way that they look above roads and weaving in and out between buildings. And then the last new major addition here, as far as vehicles go, are blimps.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002517.wav|I'd prefer borderless. So next thing I tried was taking it down to 1280x720, and that performed and looked way better despite the lower resolution. But you know what?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001669.wav|A five and a quarter inch drive bay, and yet you've got AC climate controls from a vehicle right there, just Photoshopped in place I suppose. Thermaltake, what a bunch of jokers, but yeah.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000005.wav|The game is very scripted, much like a narrative-driven linear RPG. You can have kids, but they'll never grow up and adults never get older, either.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000326.wav|not even necessarily the humour in there, which a lot of that seems to be pretty amusing, but I mean, it's a floppy disk without the disk inside.

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003676.wav|Oh and it’s worth noting that the gameplay you’re seeing here is being captured using original retro hardware with Creative’s Environmental Audio Extensions enabled.

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000392.wav|Life and all that. It's so real, but it's ethereal, and sometimes, like, I don't even know, you know? Right on.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001752.wav|And, again, I'm very satisfied with these flippers over here. The buttons feel really good. The microswitches are nice.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003562.wav|Well, technically there’s Hawaii and Alaska that you can't actually go to, but you can look at them on the map. And the contiguous 48? Yeah, it's all there.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001119.wav|I'm starting to like this thing more, the more I use it. It's such a dumb gimmick and it's really cheap.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001516.wav|So we will be testing that out a little bit. But yeah, let's just go ahead and take a look at the rest of this packaging, where nothing is really cool. Although, there is an another version of this that I think only came out in the UK.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001836.wav|And you also get a pair of shoes and leggings, and that's fine enough, too. I guess.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001693.wav|So of course it can light a candle, but yeah whatever. Yep yep, the outside of that gets pretty warm, that outer edge there.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001694.wav|And other assorted things I suppose. It actually, it says beverage holder on the actual package but, you know what this just strikes me as kind of an ashtray-type thing.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002222.wav|Whatever the case may be, once SimCity got into the hands of journalists and game reviewers, word of mouth did its thing. Newspaper articles, high-scoring reviews, and even a piece in Time magazine.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000866.wav|And, of course, you can add images, too. So you do that there... There you go. Look, we got an image on our CD.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001452.wav|And if you enjoyed this Sims coverage, then sweet! I’ve covered each pack here on LGR, and there are new videos on all kinds of gaming and tech topics every week otherwise.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001586.wav|You'll see what I mean once we actually try this thing out. And according to some of the contemporary articles that I was reading... and other hoopla with the press, there was a lot of people just like kind of blown away...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000877.wav|No? Okay, there's a tiny bit... Well, let me get another angle. Yeah, there's a little, tiny bit of that rocky formation coming through of the photo that we put in the background.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003583.wav|And I do mean whatever happens next. In very much 'Oregon Trail' fashion, it's a pretty random set of events in between different locations.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001531.wav|Yeah, here are the stuff they would made back in the day. They did all sort of really strange little devices. Mostly having to do with racing and flight, as you can see here.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002620.wav|Communications majors get a mobile radio station. Business gets a business planner made by Tony Stark. Science and Physical Education get a robotic skeleton of some kind.|0

That's fine, you can just play make-believe and pretend you're not a complete loser with a tiny loft.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003346.wav|Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention: this thing was made in 1995, but I can't figure out how much it actually cost to begin with because like I said... I wasn't able to actually find...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000303.wav|Ah, come on now! Do you really need to ask that? For 19 bucks, it's laughably overpriced. A single venue should cost 3 or 4 bucks at most.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000078.wav|Like, I knew The Sims 4 was coming to consoles, but I didn't know that meant the PS1! I've seen better ball pits at DashCon.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001022.wav|Back to the real world just as you left it. Except now with all your sweet future tech and experiences completely ruining it! Seriously, it's like you never had to go to the future in the first place.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000630.wav|You also get occasional rain showers, thunderstorms and fog rolling in throughout the season. Rain is just awesome in any game, but as immersive as The Sims can be, it really is fantastic here.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003593.wav|But it beats the heck out of the alternative, which is that the more you go without grub and shuteye, the more the risk of crashing increases. And nobody wants that.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002804.wav|I mentioned the quirks you'll have to deal with, and a good portion of that stems from the necessity of pixel-perfect Lemming placement. If you pause the game, you can't apply any skills, so you have to do it all in real time.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000932.wav|Okay, I don’t even know if I can convey how amusing this video was to me and my friends back then. We were all little car nuts, so seeing footage of these cars on the open road?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002467.wav|But the difference between a lot of those and That's Life is that things in The Sims were often completely custom. They weren't just maps or cities or scenarios made using some in-game editor.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003329.wav|But let's go ahead and open the box up and see what you get inside. Oh, yeah. That's good.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000705.wav|You can turn this off entirely in the options menu should you so desire, but eh, considering it’s half the point of the pack? Yeah it’s prolly worth leavin’ on for just a bit to see what it’s like.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001598.wav|all of this! (LAUGHS) It's not the most elegant solution in the world, but it works. It's science! Who cares?!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003585.wav|Yeah, if you get one of those, just go into your glove box, click the maintenance book and change the tire. Simple as that. You've just lost a bit of time is all.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001506.wav|But then again, what doesn't do that nowadays? And so, I'd say for what it set out to do, it does it surprisingly decently. And that is kind of a rarity here on Oddware.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001738.wav|Really cool. If anybody actually did buy one of these in a U.S. store at retail, or anything like that, then let me know. But, yeah, this is the only price that I've-- or the only place that I've ever actually seen the price listed, too.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000525.wav|Heh-heh, and just as an aside, I find it personally amusing that "Skylines" gets a university pack before "The Sims 4" does, but I digress. That's another topic entirely I'm sure we'll address in the future.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000055.wav|You'll also notice a totally new feature to keep up with in The Sims Medieval, and that is your Sim's religious status. Every Sim starts off as Agnostic; that is, not necessarily believing in the existence of you, the Watcher.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002566.wav|Oh, well. Still worth talking about. And on to what you're here for, starting with what you already know. The Sims 4: Vampires brings about the return of everyone's favorite Hot Topic-shopping neck suckers.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000131.wav|On the other hand, I know there are plenty of you who love this skeleton and wanna have its babies. And in that case, I think you'll enjoy City Living because it's certainly fun to screw around with while the newness lasts.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002998.wav|And in fact it'll also work in a small lake, which is pretty cool. As long as you've got some kind of water that's not polluted, you can farm water critters.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002817.wav|Get to Work. Kind of an odd title, if you think about it. I can just imagine some higher- ups at the company were like, "Hey! We need to hurry up with an expansion pack.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000943.wav|And even this. Did you guess simulation? Cuz yeah, this is NFS2’s "simulation" mode!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003009.wav|There's also the Inland Water Treatment Plant, which will clean up your water without dumping it into a waterway, so hooray! Now you get tons of ground pollution instead.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001845.wav|You just click on it and eventually a message pops up saying how you did in the form of a time. Kind of makes sense, seeing as Sims exist on a wibbly-wobbly time scale that doesn't really match the real world.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000666.wav|But then it's on to winter, which is easily my favorite of the seasons. And you know what?|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003447.wav|If they decide to obey, that is. Your pets are such appealing little floofballs that even when they’re being stubborn uncooperative punks it’s hard to be critical of them. But let’s do it anyway!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001641.wav|And... aw, man... this made Winter Race 3D seem like a masterpiece. Seriously, it was all over the place.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000467.wav|And once something is placed, there’s often no way to remove it without restarting the level. Unfortunately, the chunky mouse cursor is not optimized for this kind of precise item placement.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000929.wav|Right, so! Decades have passed and it’s finally time to review this thing. More specifically, we’re gonna be looking at Need For Speed II Special Edition from here on out.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003079.wav|Oh good, another stuff pack. It’s The Sims 4 Nifty Knitting Stuff, stuff pack number 137 for The Sims 4. Sigh.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003509.wav|They didn't even bother making a box and selling it in stores this time around. You can only download it through Origin and that makes sense because who really cares about stuff packs? Except people that do, I guess.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001097.wav|Well, this is– This is friggin' awkward. Um...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002429.wav|Twenty, twenty-five dollars. But then comes along something genuinely unique in Lunar Lakes. And I've gotta say, as soon as I saw what this was, I was pretty intrigued.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002965.wav|The biggest problem is that, uh... Hmm, how do I say this? The lot just plain doesn't work!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000592.wav|And it's pretty cool when witches meet up with each other, since then a witch duel may occur. It's rarely ever deadly, and it's a cool way to test out spells and see who's the wickedest witch of the wherever.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002027.wav|That is, you can go as hands-on or as deeply involved as you like. Want to make a Clifford the Dog knockoff? Go ahead.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000004.wav|You can customize existing castles and buildings, but you can't just go around building things from the ground up. Do Sims act autonomously or age and have families on their own?|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002800.wav|But no matter the look of the level, the gameplay remains the same: assign skills and don't let the Lemmings die. Pretty simple stuff, and it's the simplicity that makes the game so approachable and so timeless.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002396.wav|introduced maybe from the adapter? Uh, that's a little... little disappointing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001555.wav|But yeah, if I tilt it, I mean, it really does work. At least it kinda works. The problem being... I mean, the bumping is really good.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002339.wav|I really do like this expansion because not only is it trying some new things, but I also used to live on an island myself. St. Lucia, to be exact.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000792.wav|However, I would like to clarify something. Judging a pack purely by its numbers isn't always the best course of action. As with many things, games are bigger than the sum of their parts.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003366.wav|Oh! A great gun controller, indeed. You can't aim it... Uh...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000629.wav|Yes, it's a veritable Disney animated feature coming to Sim life... during spring. I half-expect friggin' Snow White to pop out of the trash can and start droning on about a smile and a song or something.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003621.wav|And it's pretty awesome, if you ask me. Same goes with ferries. No, not Tinkerbell, the boats.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003248.wav|Heh, almost never, no. But who cared! Making a mechanical monstrosity was mountains of fun!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000671.wav|Then there's ice skating, which works the same as roller skating, but you aren't restricted to the rink in this case. If you have a freshwater lake or pond, it will freeze over and you can skate on that instead.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001731.wav|And if you can't change the key bindings in your pinball game, then you can do it right here through the hardware. There is no actual software that comes with this, at least that is proprietary for this device.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000262.wav|But now you're there, and you can do as you please! Oh, but wait, you wanna go across the street to another lot? Well, that's another loading screen that's just about as long.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001792.wav|Certainly a logical choice here seeing as sims just teleport between worlds all the time anyway. And lastly, tuition! It exists.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003535.wav|If not, well the Sims 4 is pretty much the opposite of judgmental these days unless you're talking about color wheels and toddlers, but let's just ignore that. So place this stuff anywhere you please Like on your body.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001782.wav|And despite having fun with previous incarnations, I wasn’t sure how I felt about this one at first. Not only because it’s The Sims 4 and I have, shall we say, mixed feelings.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000464.wav|Although there are only eight levels, each taking less than two minutes to win once you know what to do? Xmas Ducks 2000 ended up taking me a couple of hours to finish.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000827.wav|It's pretty bad. So I would not say that this pack is necessary to everyone. But, dang it if it's not a lot of fun if you're like me and are looking for some new stuff to deal with.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001001.wav|Another mode of transport is the hover board, which is full of all kinds of "Power of Love" in my book. It's a proper replacement for walking and even if it's not made by Mattel, it's just awesome.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002456.wav|Again, not to say that it's a bad town, because overall I *do* like it. I just think that it costs too freaking much.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002626.wav|But that's getting incredibly disheartening and a little too close to home, so back to the streakers and beer pong! Yes, in addition to the old bars, you've got new ways to drink and be merry now.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002330.wav|Unless you just want to witness carnage like this. Come on, you know you do at least once. And if you play your cards right, you can actually gain control of the Kraken for your own desires, perfect for those last- minute family get-togethers.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003730.wav|Eating food can literally take half and hour. Watching a movie takes a couple hours. Getting a good night's sleep takes eight hours, etc.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003173.wav|What would you like to see in here? Running in here in terms of a system? Windows XP is kind of ideal, but maybe 2000.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003370.wav|There's only two buttons here, so I don't actually have a button for firing. So I have it on two-button firing. Which kind of makes sense, that's how you did in...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002201.wav|Each powered zone will generate traffic so long as it has at least one transportation tile directly adjacent to it. And yeah, that’s it for the necessities in the original SimCity.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003028.wav|One service being elder care, and the other being childcare. And this also comes free with the latest patch.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001082.wav|Reviews were not very kind to this back in the day, so I don't have grand expectations. But, uh, you know what?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003101.wav|Sounds like fun! Or more fun than this dinky stuff pack at any rate. And I mean, that’s it, I got nothing more to say.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001129.wav|Oooh... I have no way to turn around!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003286.wav|After all, what’s a new Sims 4 pack without another slightly-different way to directly make sims confident or angry or horny or whatever. You’ll also find some conspicuous piles of dirt.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001295.wav|It is The Sims at its most base level, but not as cheap and limited as some of the mobile versions of the game I've played over the years. In other words, I've played worse.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003552.wav|But this time around I think they got enough things right that it makes sense to me even though I'm so over stuff packs that I have a doll to slowly dismember in protest. Speaking of which, Ralph, you know the rules.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003095.wav|There’s also a workbench and a shelf packed with decorative knitting things that sims can’t use. Along with a themed hallway table and desk filled with yet more unusable knitting objects.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003382.wav|And yet somehow it's still... functional. Oh, nice!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003596.wav|Other times, they hold you at gunpoint and steal your cargo for no real reason other than because they can. I don't even think they tip you extra cash in this version.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000529.wav|And you know what? I get it. I've praised those two packs, and this one is worthy of praise as well.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002959.wav|And that's the other big addition in this package: the copious baking and recipes. Cakes, cookies, cupcakes, cobblers, bread, cinnamon rolls, pies.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001727.wav|You have a plunger right here, which is really just a little microswitch inside. In fact, everything in here is all microswitches.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000692.wav|Hey, remember when there was that community vote going on for the next Sims 4 pack, and “Eco Living” won the vote? Only to have to have its gameplay whittled down to the point that it became Laundry Stuff?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003663.wav|And if you enjoyed this video on a Cities game, then you might enjoy my others that I've done on SimCity. Or any other number of subjects that I've covered here on LGR.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002166.wav|Get Famous is not only prime let’s play fodder, but it makes for a solid bit of self-parody where the jokes practically write themselves. So yeah, Get Famous. It exists and I like it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000981.wav|This specific time and place. It's all so 21st Century, you know? Same old buildings, same old technology, same old semi-breathable air.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001473.wav|It's supposed to level the volume. I don't know. The volume is right here, obviously. This is brightness, which is... brightness.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002820.wav|Once it's installed, it, uh... Well, it just goes straight to the main menu. Oh! No loading screen artwork for me to bash this time around.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001874.wav|That just seems like the logical place for all of this, not an overpriced expansion all on its own! Ah! But, of course, the money and contract deals involved with EA make it perfectly clear why this exists!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002535.wav|And what you have to do completely changes depending on the system you have! Your processor, your RAM, your graphics card. But here, almost all of that has been taken out of the equation.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003469.wav|If having cats and dogs that you can pimp out for Simstagram followers is your thing, then this is the pack for you. It provides plenty of enjoyable gameplay, cute moments, and happy sims.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003396.wav|My hands are not tiny. I can imagine if my hands were any, ANY bit smaller. This is just unreasonable.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002741.wav|And sure, of course it has the usual set of new clothing and new hairstyles, new objects and new chairs. And that's great!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002835.wav|Mostly, it's just the same busy work all over again, but eventually you'll have enough information to go out and track down your perp, which is done by playing a game of Guess Who? You know how it goes.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002400.wav|Here are some Oddware episodes of the past linked too. And of course, there's a whole lot more on my channel with more coming every Monday and Friday. So subscribe if you'd like, or not. That's cool.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003570.wav|Mm, the mysteries of the Dakotas. But anyway, that's neither here or there. Let's take a look at this delightful, very rare box apparently, for Cross Country USA.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002082.wav|Then without fail, it will park itself right outside of your front door like a Pedobear van or something. Then it's off to its next victim, dingly little tune blaring throughout the land.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002072.wav|Each one of these have to be fed, played with and cleaned, just like any other pet, and you can even carry them around with you. Oddly enough, it seems that like cars, these animals can just be stuck in your pocket.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002874.wav|And as always, thank you very much for working. For wor–for watching. Thank you for watching.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002280.wav|New videos every Monday and Friday, so subscribe if you want to, unless YouTube unsubscribes you, and then who cares anymore? And as always, thank you very much for watching.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001490.wav|Which I am. So that's fine. I'm surprised at how clear it is, though.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003660.wav|If you ask me, no. What I wanted most was the ability to play the game I payed for. You know, years ago? Several times over?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000121.wav|And finally, there are a whole bunch of new buy mode objects on offer, as you'd expect, including those rundown used objects I'm so fond of. And wouldn't you know it: there are chairs.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000782.wav|Did you enjoy something about this video? Well I've got plenty more on The Sims 3 and a bunch of other stuff, too.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001716.wav|I've done a bunch of them over the years, and more are always in the works in some form or another. Along with other videos of all kinds, throughout the weeks of the year.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002944.wav|Just... wow! Cities: Skylines is a total slap in the face to SimCity 5, and, man, is it a great thing to behold! And finally, the whole game costs $29.99.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001298.wav|The Sims Social has a certain appeal, but for me, it lasted all of ten minutes. If you're off somewhere and you can't play any of the full Sims games, it might be okay for a quick diversion.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000623.wav|It's all here. "Fun for every season." Oh yeah? Well, what about when you pick up every stitch? I see no mention of the season of the witch, so I'm calling bullcrap.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003161.wav|All right, let's do this fan controller deal. I've never used this myself, but I did purchase it used. Which way's up, which way is down?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001383.wav|Mmm. Shame. But it serves them right for decorating their house like that. It, uh, y-yeah, I–I should stop looking.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001564.wav|Come on! That's right, suck it! Zombies! This is the future guys. I'm telling 'ya.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002515.wav|There's also some UI scaling weirdness. It doesn't really scale how I would hope that it would. And there's no way to change the UI to a custom scale, at least not in full screen.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001055.wav|And Christmas puzzle games are even rarer. In fact, I think this is the only one. And luckily, it is completely awesome.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001067.wav|Okay, I got it out of its cellophane prison here, and yes, this is it! This is the Pool Shark! And it does look a lot like a mouse, and you know what? It actually is!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001839.wav|That plant covered cement thing with a hole in it. Three lights of different heights that all look exactly the same. And a rock that lights up and looks suspiciously unfinished.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001394.wav|You really only have three categories of stuff this time: clothing for women, clothing for men, and furniture with an implied aggressive disposition. Aren't they so edgy?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002985.wav|The last pack for this was back in May of 2019, but you know what, I'll take it. It's rather fortuitous timing because of, I don't know about you, but I've been finding myself rather physically isolated recently, and you know what?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002355.wav|Let me just hold this thing in place! OK, so yeah if you move it around then, this is not like a pencil at all but...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003305.wav|Although, it does seem like sims are oddly attracted to using it for putting down food they’ve prepared. I’m not sure why but if they make some food and it goes missing, it’s probably in the display case next to the cursed skulls.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000754.wav|Screw you guys at YouTube screwing all this crap up and Google and whoever else... man! Ahem, anyway, this is... the town that looks like this.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001659.wav|Man, what a disappointment. I was really hoping to play at least one game... with my mind halfway competently, but...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000682.wav|You can't make aliens in Create a Sim, but you can befriend them and eventually welcome them into your household. They're mostly like ordinary Sims except... you know, they're aliens.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000049.wav|No moving walls or making new rooms, so if you're expecting castle building, just forget it. Purchasing pre-built upgrades to your castle is an option later, but that's it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001691.wav|I wasn't sure, I don't know I wasn't sure. You never know with these things, weird Thermaltake devices. Okay, so let's try to light something, let's see.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002972.wav|If you would like to see more videos on more Sims things, or, you know, other stuff, because I do other stuff, like all the time, then why not check out some of these? I'm told they're pretty okay.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001880.wav|Granted it does come with a couple dozen more objects than previous stuff packs, but they pretty much all suck. Okay, maybe that’s a bit harsh, but you know what?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002380.wav|He has a YouTube channel called xeroxcape. Go check it out if you'd like. He's got some interesting projects going on there as well.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000126.wav|There are no drivable cars or public transit or anything, so you don't have to worry about parking or traffic. You don't have to worry about proximity to your job or friends since Sims just teleport there anyway.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003340.wav|You got Doom cheat codes, Heretic cheat codes, Rise of the Triad cheat codes. No "Decent" cheat codes.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002032.wav|You can also customize your pets' traits now which give them individual personalities and flaws. You can even alter their voice to set them even further apart from the animal crowd.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001838.wav|Four tables with translucent bits and corners that appear lethally sharp. Some predictable bathroom items for your predictable bathroom.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000761.wav|The buildings look awesome, these parks look awesome, the streets look awesome, the boardwalk kind of beachy area here look frickin' awesome. I mean, I just– I think this is cool.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002658.wav|So, yes, if you ask me, University Life is worth grabbing if you find the price agreeable and you want a fun new stage in life for your Sims. And if you don't, well, I guess you could always take up streaking.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002554.wav|But I really hope to see that because I would love to see these fully fixed up and become the best possible versions of these first two games that they can be. They deserve it!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002674.wav|Mm, timeless. Mr. Brandon and Mr. Van den Bos follow up their work on Unreal and composed a good chunk of the soundtrack, along with contributions from five other talented tracker musicians.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000138.wav|promised. Anyone else just love these big gatefold boxes that flipped open on the front? It's like there was way too much cool stuff for marketing to restrain themselves to just the back of the box.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003070.wav|But honestly the greatest part about this pack were the item names full of innuendo and sexual connotations. "Glamour Puss" and "Delicate Dangling Participle"? Ooh, yeah, talk dirty to me Sims team!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003549.wav|Did we really need another stuff pack right now? No! Absolutely not.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000515.wav|C’mon dude, dude ranch dude. The price they’re charging is perplexing. Even disregarding my own preferences, I do not see what merits $40.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001493.wav|I haven't played this in a while. Let's just say that. It's weird to not be able to move my head.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001169.wav|Should be simple enough right? And eh, you’d think. I mean, it kind of works, but only for placing buildings and spawning units.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002338.wav|So, is The Sims 3: Island Paradise worth buying or not? As one might expect, it retails for $40 USD. And I'd say it's... 90 percent worth it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001578.wav|This will not just play with anything. You do need other software that's made specifically by The Other 90% or... whoever else...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003005.wav|Aesthetic diversification really is its shining attribute. You get harbors at sunset, and boatloads of boats, and that's that.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002095.wav|Actually, the whole pack feels a lot like an expansion to that expansion, so depending on how you liked its way of doing things, this could be a good or a bad thing. Personally, I think it's an awesome thing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001589.wav|and everybody in the theater would be thinking "Left!" or "Right!" Like, if a character in a horror movie or something would want to go left or right, and it would change the outcome of the movie. Yeah, that never happened, either, but...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000949.wav|Now, did I care much about this as an 11-year-old? Nah, not really. If anything, my friends and I had the most fun trying to pull off the stupidest crap possible.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000849.wav|Yeah, and then you got the drive itself. And there we go. Pretty standard-lookin' external CD-RW drive with that nice Yamaha logo debossed into the top.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003384.wav|Whatever, man. You could probably pinball on a toilet...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001554.wav|So here is what I am talking about this far is like, I'm not touching anything and the table is bumping. I don't know how well that showing up.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001920.wav|It looks like she's preparing to let loose some Katy Perry-branded glittery farts. Maybe that's where all this glitter on the box comes from!|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003345.wav|Mmm, yes. And then we've got the diagnostic disk which is just for like testing out, making sure everything works. Which you can do that in the games, you don't really need that.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003337.wav|A little thumb button right here and a thumb stick. Which, I swear, that is a keyboard key... with some other kind of...|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002543.wav|The community does a good job with that on Steam Deck, but I did nothing at all. These “Legacy” re-leases do not support controllers natively. Oh yeah, and the mods mods still work for both The Sims 2 and The Sims 1.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001544.wav|So that's cool. And there's actually two different functions for each buttons. Like, you press it halfway, it'll press one button.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000853.wav|And at this point it just looks like any other CD-RW that you have on Windows XP. So it is ready to go.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002899.wav|Well, here it is; after over a decade of waiting, us SimCity fans have finally got what we wanted. The next flagship game in the SimCity franchise, Cities: Skylines.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000264.wav|Augh! Yeah, you got it, another loading screen! After thirty hours of gameplay, I got positively sick of loading screens in The Sims 4. Why would they do this?!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000253.wav|Sims can also talk to more than one Sim at once, or leave and enter a conversation while performing other actions like changing seats or getting food. These means that keeping your Sim's social needs fulfilled is easier than ever.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002351.wav|Same difference! So, yeah, as far as like what these buttons and everything do, I think this is about to show us.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000421.wav|And if you liked what you saw here then fantastic! So stick around if you'd like more of this, there are new videos every Monday and Friday. And as always thank you very much for watching!|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000038.wav|And you can make them look a lot like Altaïr or Ezio from Assassin's Creed, so that's plus five points to the Spy. So, now for the gameplay itself.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000390.wav|Speaking of pants, you get some. And shirts. And hair, too. Because nothing says Wellness like a trendy new hairstyle and a top with a corporate logo on it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001132.wav|Oh, man. Ah, whatever. Polygon was still worse at it than me. Well, that's pretty much it for the pool controller.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001321.wav|I would be totally on-board if it actually came with kitchen items that at the very least looked unique. But, nope.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002443.wav|There are also some Create a Sim items, although not very many. Just a few sets of clothing that look... kind of... nehh...

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001647.wav|And last up is "MindDoodle." You got "MindSketch," "MindPatterns," "MindCritters," "MindTravel The World," and "MindTravel USA"... and "MindKampf"– haha, no you don't, but...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002939.wav|And this all ties in with the Steam Workshop feature of the game which allows you to share and download mods and custom content. They've made it so that just about every aspect of the game can be modded.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000608.wav|Eh, it's just a door. It acts like a door. It's a door. But it looks like a bookcase, and that's awesome. Fitting in with the witch's lair is the magic mirror.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001809.wav|The drama practically writes itself and this is precisely the kind of life simulation melodrama that I love. Because when sims get desperate, it’s not long before things break down.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001527.wav|I would be curious to find out in the development, like, what made them do this? I know there were a ton of pinball games back in the day. Like, for example, there's another one that you can get with it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000772.wav|Like, it'll be done after about one and a half Sim days of constant work. Still, though, its' cool that it's here, and you can also now woohoo in the car.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003328.wav|And yet this makes it look like the best thing ever, but of course it does, right? "Ergonomic grip." I love this particular quote. You'll see why in a moment.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000742.wav|And I especially appreciate the possibilities for off-the-grid gameplay with generating your own water, power, and retrofitting old appliances. It’s way better than what was introduced in Island Living in that respect.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000596.wav|From skill-boosting potions to instant obesity. It's awesome to throw these evil things at Sims and watch them squirm.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000605.wav|Werewolves are normally awesome because they're unpredictable and blood-thirsty monsters. These... aren't.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000726.wav|Which is accomplished by passing the Modern Development or Green Initiatives Neighborhood Action Plans, but again, this is only going to affect the visuals in one area. That’s it.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002616.wav|Anyway, the driving forces behind everything here – at least, in theory – are the classes themselves. You've got a schedule to keep up with, so planning ahead is pretty vital to actually earning a degree.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001106.wav|So, what's interesting about this is the fact that, uh... it barely works. Wow, okay, so it just– I must be playing a really easy mode because it's lining me up for these shots.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002416.wav|Well, you'll have to wait until it releases in September of 2014 for all of those thoughts, but I've got some crap to spew anyway. But first the positive: I'm really starting to dig the new look of the Sims themselves.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000479.wav|Enter your name on the high score table. Yeeeaaah, I’d rather have the punch and cake. Or maybe some duck, I could go for that.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002208.wav|And it’s a scary thing in SimCity, with a single flame having the potential to take out the entire map if you don’t pay attention. Still, the way you tackle these issues is pretty basic.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002530.wav|Presumably a licensing issue, although the H&amp;M Stuff pack is still included, so they did retain some licenses and whatever. There is already a fix for this within a day.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000854.wav|And in terms of the software, that's also a little simpler than I thought it might be. Yeah, that thing whirring to life has got some noise.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002870.wav|To me, this expansion is an example of what brilliance may lie beneath that shell of initial disappointment. And as Sims fan, that is plenty exciting.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001439.wav|But if you prefer a more open-ended experience filled with tons of objects and activities to be played with however you want? This is probably not the pack for you.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000401.wav|If you found this video relaxing or something good at all, then great! Why not watch more?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001746.wav|Like I'm-- banging on it-- every which way, and if you remember the Wizzard controller, it was like-- I could do this and it would be tilting like crazy. Well, it doesn't seem to be motion sensitive at all.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003351.wav|That's a bit much. Alrighty, well let's go ahead and just plug this thing in and try some of this shareware out! Okay, I've got the gun plugged in.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000024.wav|Just be careful in your actions, as Monarchs have a tendency to be assassinated. The Knight is mostly around for combat purposes, learning new fighting moves and preparing for duels in the barracks.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000740.wav|And that’s about it for The Sims 4 Eco Lifestyle expansion pack! Is it worth forty dollars? Nah. Is it worth your time though?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000060.wav|To encourage you to play as more heroes, there's also an achievement system in the game. This not only gives you a list of things to do, but also allows you to unlock new items for your Sims, and it panders to achievement whores.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000566.wav|Enough of that, on with the life states, with the first one being vampires. Now you may be thinking: What the cow?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002326.wav|Except when they don't, as is the case with the new creature/life state: the Mermaid. Mmm. Mer-people.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002310.wav|So, yes, you can stick it in your pocket and it'll fit. Next is real estate, although oddly enough, this actually ties in to boats.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000346.wav|And if you enjoyed this video, perhaps you'd like to see some others. I've got some linked to right here. You can click on the annotations.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000601.wav|But hey, at least you can... scratch the couch. That's... that's cool... You can also howl at the moon, more or less.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000930.wav|This is really what the game should’ve been from the start, released only 6 months after the original in 1997. It’s got new cars, new tracks, new race modes and optional options.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002394.wav|Hee hee, whatever. That's kind of to be expected. You're never supposed to do this. And I died.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000302.wav|And that is all for the Last Venue of Amore and the last venue of The Sims 3 in general. Is it worth it?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002055.wav|Another thing you may run across in the wild is a wild horse with a freaking narwhal horn sticking out of its head. Apparently, these are called unicorns and are the special creature in The Sims 3 Pets.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001083.wav|We're gonna find out here soon enough. I do like this though: the troubleshooting. "It's a well-designed mechanical device." "However," you might screw it up.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003629.wav|So if you want to live out your blimpy fantasies, go right ahead. If nothing else, the aesthetic is really cool. Sort of weirdly futuristic for such a retro technology.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001345.wav|Cheap and black-and-white is better than nothing. What am I supposed to do when I'm taking a dump now, EA? Alright, well is The Sims 3: Outdoor Living Stuff worth buying?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000430.wav|You know have there's air around us, you wouldn't really call it a liquid but it's definitely a fluid. You know it's there.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000767.wav|I mean, you could figure it out, but it's just, uh... eh... It should not have taken me 15 minutes to make this coaster. But it did.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000330.wav|This pack really is just for kids, for better or worse. Kinda too bad because this space cat shirt seems tailor-made for Duke Nukem.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001099.wav|How am I gonna hold down S and this? I guess I need to change the mouse configuration. All right, that should be better.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002197.wav|The latter affects your starting capital, frequency of disasters, taxation tolerance, maintenance costs and more. And seriously, hard mode is no joke.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003454.wav|Quirks are charming little behavioral habits that range from being afraid of computers to being enamored watching TV. Sometimes you’ll have a dog that’s just obsessed with the pool.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003142.wav|Hmm, I might like this up top, still never actually opened this thing up or seen it in action. A nifty remote.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002845.wav|Oh, and you'll quite possibly come back pregnant. Dudes included. Yep, Get to Work marks the return of playable aliens in The Sims.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001528.wav|This is by the people that made Crystal Caliburn, say pinball table. Or uh, I think this is just a table. Yeah, it comes with a CD-ROM called Loony Labyrinth.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002121.wav|Or even, like, iced coffee for that matter. There's none of that either, which is downright bizarre. But, yeah, while I do have a few qualms, overall I really enjoy Dine Out.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003375.wav|Okay, this right here–ooh, crap. This is easily the most comfortable way to play. I actually have the gun... right in between my crotch...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002043.wav|They can also have romantic relationships and, yes, that means pet woohoo. It's not nearly as absurd as it is with the Sims.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000572.wav|The only way to atone for this is to create a Blade Sim for the next expansion. Just makin' that clear. Enough of the unfortunate sparkles. Next up, we have zombies.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001626.wav|yeah, it's pretty much the same result. Just made it harder to stand up, and I felt like a flamingo, but whatever. Maybe a little extra capacitance will help.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002360.wav|Oh, whoa! Alright, cool! Theres... that's working, that's neat.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003004.wav|So having a bunch of different types of fishing boats out there, yeah, it's a cool look. And really that's about it for the harbor part of Sunset Harbor.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002305.wav|Yes, take yourself down to the Island Paradise city where the grass is green and the girls are... passable, at the very least.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000817.wav|LGR: Well, that's not the only use for radio, though. Colossal Order didn't just cram in a bunch of disasters without providing prevention measures, of which radio plays a key part.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001071.wav|what else, I guess really it's just the fact that it's USB is kind of interesting, so I might just have to try this out on a modern machine See if it works. And then, of course, there's just this little roller.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003640.wav|Cities: Skylines was already worth playing, but it's even more so with the free update that has been added alongside Mass Transit. And as for Mass Transit itself, I mean, for 13 bucks, it's solid.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000513.wav|And of course, there are seven new chairs on offer here, plus two new stools. Not counting the horse stool, you probably don’t wanna sit on that.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001283.wav|I guess the biggest reason for this was maybe so people wouldn't have to start all over when their Sim died or something. But come on, that's like giving someone a steak and then setting it inside of a glass case they can never open.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001511.wav|I cannot wait to dive in this thing, this is a supreme oddware. Is it going to be good. So this right here is the Thrustmaster Wizzard Pinball Controller.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002333.wav|Gather enough information and it'll open up to you and become another piece of real estate, free for you to build whatever you want to on it.

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000594.wav|Just add the threat of getting pretties and little dogs, and we're set for one "Oz-some" time. Another huge thing to screw with is alchemy.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003539.wav|Including a birdhouse that can't be used by birds, and a rather hypnotic wind catcher. Or... makeshift wind turbines if you're crafty with those bracket keys.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000911.wav|It's a gimmick. It's not the most useful thing. You can totally see where they were coming from in the old reviews, where, you know, I mean this right here, look at that. There's not much to it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000570.wav|They can also receive the Immortal Lifetime award, which of course means they'll never age or die. Although, this also causes them to sparkle in the sunlight.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001680.wav|I'm no expert in how the way these things function, but it just seemed dubious from the get-go. Which is one reason that I wanted to take a look at it, because yeah.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001292.wav|All you can do is go to their house and you can see them as an NPC. And it's not like you're even seeing what they're doing in real time. You can't chat with them, you can't do anything but look at their avatar stand there.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003542.wav|Speaking of progress, check this out! There's a radio that's called a "Plumbox Box" which claims to be from hundreds of years in the future, and may be the head of an advanced cyborg.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001399.wav|Another thing that doesn't excite me is the furniture with an implied aggressive disposition. I mean, you only get 14 items, and a lot of it can't be recolored because of the silly designs placed on them.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002533.wav|And this release here, at least in my experience, is doing that very well right off the bat. And I also didn't run into the same weird resolution performance issues that I did with the Sims 1 rerelease.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001456.wav|This is the first one of these that actually made it to the public. They were showing these off as early as 1996. If you look online, it looks like it was released in 1997, but I can't really find any real records of that.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003614.wav|And if anyone has a copy of the elusive Teacher's Edition with all the extra customization and networking features, please get in touch or upload it somewhere. That'd be the ultimate version if we could find it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002331.wav|While you're out on the open sea, you may well run into these islands that are secluded by smoky clouds. Once may assume it's a chain smoker's convention or Beijing's atmosphere taking a vacation, but nope!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003348.wav|The only thing I could find was that Computer Gaming World... uh, quip. And they didn't mention the price there either.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000263.wav|Ah, thirty seconds later, there we go! Things are good here– Oh, but wait, I need to check on my other Sims' needs but I can't see them because for some reason it doesn't let you if they're offscreen. So I'll just choose to play them.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001500.wav|Goodness. Whew. Mmm...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002812.wav|And there are plenty of other ports out there, and with these came all sorts of tweaks. I'm only gonna cover a couple notable ones here, starting with the original Amiga version.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001996.wav|Hunhh, get it? Cow "tipping," nyeh-heh. Affecting livestock even more directly is the food you give them, or more specifically, the treats.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001637.wav|and I had no idea what was even going on. Because, again, I would look away or something... and it just felt like the ball would go towards the direction that I would LIKE it to go...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001561.wav|So uh, that kinda sucks. I was totally given up, but that's kind of a, uh, I even don't know what I am doing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001091.wav|And, it's... it's working as a mouse. Although, I do need to clarify one thing here, and that is that the little switch on the bottom doesn't actually switch between the mouse buttons necessarily.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001640.wav|Once again, you press spacebar to begin... and you can press the up and down arrows to adjust your speed. Otherwise, it's the same binary movement: left... and right.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001766.wav|But even though it did contain new objects, there still wasn't a whole lot to choose from. EA has answered the request with the first Stuff Pack, High-End Loft Stuff.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001639.wav|Next up is "MindSkier." And there are way too many race events than necessary in this game, but whatever. I just played the slalom because "lala-lalom" is a good word.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003354.wav|We CAN, actually! Let's put it on Nightmare. Ha ha! Because this thing should be amazing, right? "This skill level isn't even remotely fair." *pfft* Fair?! Who needs fair? I've got the Demon Gunn.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001568.wav|Don't let the Imp see me! He's in the corner! Oh, how do I open things?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003327.wav|in Computer Gaming World. And they trashed it! They called it "ludicrous" and "overpriced" and basically just overall awful!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002106.wav|Yeah, genders are pretty much all fluid now, and it's about freakin' time, if you ask me. I never understood why you had such a limitation in a game like this in the first place.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000547.wav|And, of course, there's some other miscellaneous things, like new radio stations and some other little policies and buildings and such that are unique to each individual type of campus. But, you know, it all serves the same basic purpose.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000922.wav|This was complete fiction, of course, the real GT90 was a one-off concept car painted white. But I didn’t care.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002780.wav|And if you did, there are plenty more with new ones coming out every Monday and Friday here on LGR. And as always, thank you very much for watching.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003153.wav|Ah, let's see, feels like we should have some speakers, let's do the Circle Fire. Oh yeah, I forgot, this thing is really dumb.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000663.wav|I say "was" excited about, because while it's awesome when it works, it mostly didn't for me. I sent my sims to eight different houses throughout one night and only one of them had anyone home.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002034.wav|Once you've finished building your pet with a human voice, you can place your pet on any lot with human Sims. From here, it's up to you as to what you want to do, and at first it can be a bit overwhelming.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001945.wav|Oh, well. Another awesome addition is the option for your Sims to visit venues for random shows around town. Like Simfest, an annual haphazard variety show.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000874.wav|It was the worst feeling ever getting 80% through and then you get some weird buffer or disc writing problem. All right, and it burned our ridiculously tiny three-megabyte CD-ROM image here.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002092.wav|As the title suggests, the theme this time is dining. Out. You know, just out... places.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001571.wav|I wanna play my DOS games... with my MIND! (EERIE STING) Well, you can do that.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001905.wav|Unless you've got the static "snow mode" activated, there's not much new to play with in this pack. That begs the question, Is Snowfall worth buying or not?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003393.wav|Final thoughts on the Demon Gunn. Well, it's just as sucky as you imagine from the horrible title.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002714.wav|Effectively, mutators are smaller gameplay modifications that switch up existing game types. Things like the aforementioned chainsaw and sword options.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000223.wav|And that sucks because I use that for friggin' everything in the game, from garage doors to G-strings. You wanna make this shirt red?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001974.wav|A quaint little village nestled into rolling green hills with drystone fences dotting the landscape. Pleasant, comfy, unique regional architecture.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000852.wav|I've already done it. It pretty much just does it itself. The Adaptec SCSI controller card that's in this system just goes ahead and finds it and it's that right there. It sees it as a CRW-F1S.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000394.wav|Uh, doesn't exactly seem to be pleasant to the Sims, but I'm sure it's therapeutic. Some lovely new aquariums are included, too, which fits the overarching theme of relaxing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001074.wav|there we go. And it sort of telescopes like this. So you have a pool... cue.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003256.wav|More or less exactly what Flight Simulator 4.0 was designed to work with. As such, the performance would’ve looked more like this running in higher-res VGA mode. Yeah, quite a bit slower indeed.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000270.wav|There are no cars in the game, except in the background as decorations, and the trains and steamboats you see are the same. They're just there to look nice and do nothing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003349.wav|They mentioned it being expensive, so... I just gonna say that this thing cost $700... when it was brand new in 1995.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001047.wav|I guarantee it. It... pretty much always works. Unless you smell like butt.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000006.wav|Do expansions or mods for The Sims 3 work with it? NOPE! It has nothing to do with The Sims 3, remember?|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001625.wav|and it's just kind of doing whatever it wants to. I thought, "Hey, why restrict myself to fingers? I got other phalanges and whatnot." So I stuck it on my toe and...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000561.wav|In fact, if you want to jump right into many of these, you can do so with Create a Sim. All of the new ones, minus zombies, can be chosen, as well as two old ones: ghosts and genies.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001084.wav|Like putting it in direct sunlight. Where have I heard that before? And do not spill liquids on it. You know, whatever.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001653.wav|Not with MindSketch, MindPatterns, MindCritters. They're all the same frickin' thing! Just one is with drawings, one is with patterns...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003548.wav|Which is a great way to meet new victims-- Er-- friends. So, that's the Sims 4: Backyard Stuff.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003128.wav|it's just an amusing thing. I've covered this over an LGR Blerbs, it's just, it's the same thing as the Xray, just even sillier in my opinion.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001059.wav|This is the Interact Pool Shark. The PC pool cue controller for "real feel" simulation.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003560.wav|And you know, it's kind of wild. Back then, American Truck Simulator by SCS did not even exist yet. That didn't come out until 2016, almost a year after I made that video.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001594.wav|I guess they didn't mind. You also get some registration stuff, as well as ads... for more of their products that you could buy from them.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000337.wav|Just be careful you don't pull a Toy Story 3 and forget about them as soon as you get a bit older. Dang it, man! Keep it together!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002434.wav|This is both a good and a bad thing. Lunar Lakes is a very unique-looking town. It is based... on a moon...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003732.wav|Of course, this is where the online store comes in to save the day! Kind of like if Superman burned your house to the ground and then asks for your credit card to put out the fire.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000783.wav|Click one of these video clips and it'll take you to 'em. Or just click Subscribe because I put out a new video every week, and there's a ton more coming. And as always, thank you for watching.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000862.wav|And it works pretty much like any other editor I've ever used for creating disc labels. I don't know what I'm creating here.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000232.wav|Buy mode is rolled up into build mode, too, and you've got quite a selection of items to pick from. Though I'm a bit conflicted with the fact that many of these have to be unlocked in-game before you can buy them.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001688.wav|So that's good. I mean that looks like your fuse you'd see, in a fuse box of your car. So uh, sure!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000979.wav|And if you enjoyed this episode of LGR then awesome! I’ve covered other NFS games in the past and I’ll do more in the future, with other retro randomness happening here each week.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001464.wav|These are completely non-see-through. Some of the later ones were translucent, or they had a toggle, but this one does not. But yeah, it's interesting how this works as far as the displays themselves.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000428.wav|Is that why this year has been so...? What? No, no this year just sucks.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001674.wav|Power supplies, PC cases, cooling systems, input devices, hard disk enclosures, and of course, weird five and a quarter inch drive bay mods. And typically at rather low-budget prices.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000397.wav|But yeah, it's a solid pack, and it put me in a super chill place. It comes down to whether or not you think your Sims need to have access to these activities, items and skills, and..|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001128.wav|Oh, there we go. I'm even forg– I'm already forgetting to hold down... the thing to do this kind of aiming.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000757.wav|You know what? This is probably the most appealing town to have come out so far. One of my favorite towns to have come with anything in The Sims 3 was the one that came with Late Night: Bridgeport.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002650.wav|Everything from Hacky Sacks to whiteboards, beat-up chairs to new variations on old electronics. And lastly, you get a new Life State with the return of Plant Sims.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002574.wav|Beyond this, you get an array of clothing, hair and accessories that's ideal if your Sim is a total goth ball. Mostly, this stuff is for adults, but there are a few options for younger Sims as well.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003505.wav|And if you enjoyed the coverage of this pack for Skylines why not check out some of my others, I've covered all of them so far! And I do all sorts of other things here every week on LGR.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003507.wav|'Cause that's life, man. At least my life. What is life? I need a pizza.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003049.wav|The only thing that kept it installed on my hard drive was the town itself, which had this cool neverending fall aesthetic. Also, that ice cream truck still creeps me out and I wish it would just crash into a telephone pole and explode.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003385.wav|and you would be just as fine as this. Okay. I got one more to try here, just because I wanted to try it with something a little bit newer. And this is going to be Rise of the Triad, the 2013...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000974.wav|Yeah the PlayStation version, that’s a thing too. It’s a great port, all things considered. Really, the only port.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000681.wav|Once they show up, they'll probably abduct you and do wondrous things to your bodily orifices, sometimes resulting in pregnancy. And yes, even male Sims can get pregnant this way.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002773.wav|It's a downright simplistic approach, when you think about it. I mean, where are the outside forces at play? What about the local environments, socioeconomic status and the kids' mental or physical predispositions?|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001742.wav|Yeah, so you have to actually start the game with F1, which isn't mapped to anything on there. So you actually do still need a keyboard. That kind of makes sense.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000538.wav|But these people will, of course, pile into your campuses, instead of tourist traps. I mean, they might do that too, but mostly campuses.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001347.wav|Plus the content is really just a pile of random stuff that may or may not appeal to you at all. Personally, I find this Stuff Pack to be somewhat of a loser.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000575.wav|Might want to stop by the Sweet Treats House of Pain while you're at it. There's plenty of candies Sim flesh in there, though it might be a bit charred. So yeah, being a zombie isn't that great, and it wears off over time.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001341.wav|It's nothing I find that attractive or appealing at all. In fact, it's some of the most bland clothing I've seen in the game so far. I guess if you really want to make yourself look like Mr. Rogers, then go right ahead.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001301.wav|I've played a million times better games for free, all without being told I need to bother people or pay up. I have nothing against Facebook games.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001911.wav|Then you might like some of my other videos. I've covered After Dark, the main Skylines games and SimCity stuff and a bunch of other... whatever. So, uh, subscribe if you'd like to do that or just look on my channel.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003609.wav|And that's about it for Cross Country USA, the 1995/96 Home Edition. And man, is it one of those edutainment titles I wish I knew about back in the day.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001068.wav|It's got mouse buttons. Uh, a wheel down there. And a little switch for switching the mouse buttons to do what you want.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000039.wav|The basic gist of The Sims Medieval is that you've got a kingdom to manipulate, and a storyline to complete. The beginning and end points are basically always going to be the same, but it's how you get there that changes.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001027.wav|Just an expansion that keeps the core Sims gameplay in tact, but somehow introduces a new location and/or time period. And in that regard, this is well worth the money to me.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002696.wav|Heh, and whoever’s idea it was to tie the camera to the player’s bouncing head model whenever you’re decapitated? Yeah, just brilliant.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001101.wav|Okay. So, it– It doesn't actually do anything if you just hold it, so you have to do this... aw, crap. Okay.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001621.wav|So there's a mode for left and right... and there's a mode for up and down. You can adjust the "ThoughtWave sensitivity" in the options.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003365.wav|It completely negates the fact that it is a gun controller at this point. Do I wanna go in here? I don't really want to, so screw it. Just get to the end of the level.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000423.wav|'K, well consider me intrigued. Should we be using a mask or anything? I mean I've got one if you need it, but uh.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001327.wav|It's lame. Yep, you need to get off your pasty butt and go outside and enjoy the fresh air. Besides, what real fun is there to have inside anyways?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002324.wav|Though you can also get it on inside the cave with a scuba diving partner, which is cool, I suppose. Though the logistics and particulars of how exactly that works intrigue the crap out of me.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001851.wav|Anyway, that's The Sims 4: Fitness Stuff pack. Is it packed with enough stuff for you to spend $10 on it?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001526.wav|Yeah, you pretty much just plug it in, and then calibrate it like a joystick in the Windows 95. And the... then there's a stuff for a... yeah, the Full Tilt! Pinball.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001649.wav|or something, but you do it with your mind, sort of. Again, because it only does left or right, or up and down, you actually have to choose with the mouse... what you wanna do.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002591.wav|Now I'll certainly keep using some of the new Buy Mode objects, because those are awesome. But by and large, I have zero desire to play through my Sims' lives as a Vampire. It's fun to do once, though.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000236.wav|And being a Sims game, there are at least 35 chairs on offer to suit your bum-comforting desires. Surely there could be more and I expect a chairs expansion in 2015.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000230.wav|Rooms and even the entire house can be picked up and moved as a whole unit. You can place pre-made rooms inside and around other rooms. Everything is adjustable in ways that satisfy me completely.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001658.wav|There were a bunch of other programs but... I cannot IMAGINE paying the $25-40, or whatever it was. Yeah, that's it for the MindDrive for now. Ugh...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001107.wav|Playing pool! It's friggin' scraping up my desk, but I'm playing pool.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000520.wav|And in the meantime I’ve got plenty of other stuff I cover here on LGR, so stick around if you’d like! And thank you very much for watching.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001541.wav|So, I can use anything obviously, Velcro will work too, but these come off, without leaving sticky crappy residue. And they keep these things in place. You just put on there.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001320.wav|There's not even two dozen objects most of which are indistinguishable from stuff in the base game and a bunch of clothing. I'm sorry, but not only does that make the title confusing but this is just not one I can recommend at all.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001648.wav|anyway, these are all little mini-games that aren't really games at all. The first three are all the same. Basically, it's just like Kid Pix or Paint...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001338.wav|Now I know clutter objects have been a part of The Sims 3 from the very beginning, but this just feels weak to me. I don't know why, there's just a lot of it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003326.wav|It's really just a really boring box, other than the colors. I kinda like the colors but... "Your prayers have been answered?" These quote are all– I can't...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000533.wav|And, lastly, the university faculties being the School of Law, School of Medicine, and School of Science. Now, as for playing and earning all these items, it's the same basic process as the last two packs.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001314.wav|Oh, wait, dishwashers were added in a free patch you say? Well, forget I even mentioned it! You don't need this pack after all!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001339.wav|You get no new trees, rocks, flowers, or anything like that that would be outdoorsy, you would think. But, oh, you get a bunch of fake fruit for your fake life that's so fake, you can't even fake eating it.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000040.wav|Life Stories, Pet Stories, Castaway Stories– you'll know what to expect here. Or even the challenges of World Adventures or the job activities of Ambitions expansion for The Sims 3, yeah, it's the same kind of thing.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001583.wav|Now this thing was released with some restrictions. They were actually trying to get this thing to... read very specific thoughts.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002325.wav|Hehe... Gives a whole new meaning to the term "wetsuit," too, does it not? Just keep an eye on your oxygen, since Sims definitely need to be able to breathe in order to stay alive.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001706.wav|Don't know how much power this takes, I don't think it's a lot. There we go, and let's see.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000647.wav|Yep, in the words of the immortal Butt-head, the sun sucks, especially during a heat wave. Thankfully, there are several ways to stay cool, many of them involving water.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001651.wav|that you want the cursor to move... with these little arrows at the bottom. Then you click and move the rest of the cursor...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000710.wav|It’s easy to go overboard too, like, say you wanna go hardcore green but already have a roof full of solar panels? Build a hundred bushes in your basement and watch the eco meter swing left.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003357.wav|I have this instinctive thing to be like this, right, to aim, but obviously it's not the case. I could just do it like this.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000373.wav|And, again, if you'd like more information on what you actually do in the game, I recommend my full Sims 4 review, which is linked to right here. And there are also other videos going up every Monday and Friday, so stick around if you'd like.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000746.wav|And if found this review useful or entertaining, then do check out my previous Sims game coverage. Or any of the other stuff I post each week right here on LGR both new and old.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000816.wav|Yakisoba! It literally means "fried noodles." MALE ANNOUNCER: The Relaxation Station. Songs for when you just...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001832.wav|fitness! Oh, goodie. What do you think, Ralph?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001858.wav|Combined these provide most every kind of object your Sim could want. So, really, what’s left?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002388.wav|This is purely because I think this is fun. My apologies to my teammates, whoever I was playing with. Um... I was effectively useless, just dicking around.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000984.wav|"Play with traveling to the future... and back!" Shape and alter the future! Disrespect your fellow man!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002304.wav|Once you reach the main menu, the main thing to do is use the menu to select the neighborhood or city you want to play. Island Paradise comes with a nifty new one called Isla Paradiso.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002298.wav|Sometimes, you just wanna get away from the hustle and bustle of the big city. Or the little city. Or the rock...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001613.wav|(LAUGHS) That kind of makes sense... considering that Ron Gordon, the... ex-president of Atari from the '70s and the founder of this company...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001634.wav|Super simple. All you control here is the ball going left and right... and you press spacebar to actually bowl the ball. Once again, it takes some adjustment, but actually...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000151.wav|Then you're whisked away to the neighborhood screen, which by glancing at the roads wouldn't appear out of place in SimCity 3000. But instead of building a city, here you're building Sims!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001397.wav|Same with dudes. And for once, there is quite a bit to choose from here. This stuff falls into the same categories as the women's clothing and it's certainly nice to see some more men's apparel.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001701.wav|And what do I use these outlets for the most in my car? Well, a dash cam but, also for charging my phone.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000583.wav|You can't exactly go flying all over the place with these, but you can hover a bit. Kind of like having a weak jetpack.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003352.wav|And Doom installed and ready to go. And of course, this being one of the games that it was touted... to work best with.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000424.wav|Yeah that makes sense. So uh, what's going on? Well yeah, that's kind of the question isn't it?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003069.wav|#6 Master Suite Stuff My, my, what a Stuff Pack! Sure, all it added were eye masks and a bunch of stuff for your bedroom, and the best I can say is, at least most of it looked half-decent.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002322.wav|But yeah, just go underwater and feel the flood begin. Fingertips so gently on your skin. Collect fish, rocks, shells, and even treasure if you're lucky and skilled enough.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001689.wav|I've ever installed in a computer but, then again you never know. We're talking about heating elements and things.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002538.wav|So all right, you get most of the content, you can add the missing stuff back. It's in widescreen, it performs well.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000216.wav|Look how WEIRD they are! Betcha can't wait to see how WEIRD their stories get! So you may as well just start a new game.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000294.wav|It's also just freaking useless for the most part, since all of the buildings are enterable, but I really don't see the point. No restaurants, no stores, just rooms that are nearly empty.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002824.wav|The better you perform and the more you suck up to the right people, the quicker you'll be promoted. Whereas in previous games you made these decisions through text and indirect influence, but here, you'll be doing it all hands-on.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003421.wav|You know, somebody actually needs to make a David Hasselhoff Sim and a KITT car for download. Please and thank you.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001061.wav|On your PC. Well, first off, a big shout out to Kennith for sending me this thing to review. Dude, you're awesome! These things are hilarious to me, and yeah, let's just go ahead and dive right into it, right?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001156.wav|Ahh I was afraid of that. Being that this is the UK version the tape is in PAL format, so it’s not only playing too fast but my NTSC VCR and TV doesn’t know what to do with the visuals either.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001552.wav|I will say though, that the buttons are themselves were surprisingly better than you might imagine feeling how flimsy they are, just on their own. But I mean it, you know...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001118.wav|USB, man. It, uh... it makes things happen. All right. Let's see, what am I doing here?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001472.wav|This AVLS is interesting. So if you turn it on, that is Auto Volume Leveling... And, uh, that, it's supposed to keep it from going too loud.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003360.wav|This at least is in a good spot to just do things. I'm having a problem, though, with this. This joystick...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001103.wav|Hold down–oh, crap! Okay, I don't need to do that. It's too sensitive!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002437.wav|You've got shooting stars and another moon. Well, I guess that's the planet that... you're... the moon... of.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002419.wav|And yeah, there's no open world. Which means you can't just go and walk around anywhere in the game anymore. You've got loading screens between each zone in the neighborhood.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002654.wav|So is The Sims 3: University Life worth buying? Well, here's the price: 40 US dollars, same as previously. And like all previous expansions, there's really quite a lot on offer here.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002273.wav|Fired that one, got another one, and they just kept spraying my computers. Fired that one too, and eventually I got a butler that I was happy to let live in my Sims' house.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000770.wav|This is a car that looks like garbage at first, and... well, it kind of is. You just sort of click on it a bunch of times and eventually it'll transform into a regular car.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000610.wav|This one's ripe. There's also a couple cool things I've always kinda sorta wanted at certain times of day on Tuesdays. Like grandfather clocks and rocking chairs.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000887.wav|And I'm gonna go in the opposite direction with the color of the text. Yeah, black with white around the edges.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001130.wav|I mean, I can turn around, but I can't– I can't back up. Oh, that's a problem.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002498.wav|I think of The Sims 2 and only on Origin. There's so many weird asterisks beside that release. And of course, there's the Mac version, but that was incomplete.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003448.wav|Pets in this pack cannot be controlled directly, at all. You can click their icon at the bottom of the screen, but all it’ll do it center the camera on them. And you know what?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001193.wav|Inside the box you get a bit of an unusual cardboard insert, one that’s built to hold the jewel case all snug so the cover screenshot is visible on the front of the box. And mine is cover variant number 2 of 4.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001507.wav|So, uh, yeah. And if you enjoyed this episode, why not stick around a little longer? Watch some more.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001125.wav|So... Let's kill some demons with a pool cue! Ha ha!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002808.wav|It includes 100 more levels divided into groups titled Tame, Crazy, Wild, Wicked and Havoc. And yes, those last couple are absolutely...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001374.wav|But yeah, that’s about it for Moschino Stuff! As with all Sims 4 stuff packs, this one costs $10. And as usual, I think that’s silly.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000251.wav|Up to three things can be done at once, as long as they don't conflict with one another. For instance, your Sim can exercise, watch TV AND talk to their spouse at the same time.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000434.wav|But I don't really remember it. I just remember waking up and not being able to really speak properly. And then all of a sudden you're there and then I'm here.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001892.wav|Another new ploppable building is the sauna which acts as an additional health service building. Because what's healthier than stripping down with a bunch of strangers and sweating your nuts off?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003311.wav|The Demon Gunn... with two N's! Oh, yeah, sorry, the Demon...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000032.wav|Playing as them also gives you the chance to play some pretty fun mini-games. So give them a shot as soon as you can. There's also the Wizard or Witch, which... is pretty much what you would expect.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003347.wav|listings for this– for those reviews and stuff that it has in the back. I couldn't find them in any archives.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001461.wav|Looks like something out of– I don't even know what. Some sort of like '90s cyberpunk kind of thing. I mean look at these! These are amazing!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001398.wav|Although, honestly, I make my own clothing for my dude Sims, and what I don't make I get for free through custom content. So I really can't say that this excites me too much.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003367.wav|Let's, uh, let's just get out of here. I'm gonna try... let's try another game.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002368.wav|I don't care, let's just do a run! I've put it into easy-fly mode, let's see if that works... Oh, crap! Alright!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001683.wav|"What will they think of next?" Another user saying, "It's too cool!", but they admit that it's totally pointless.

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003313.wav|First up, I have to thank Dave "Foxhacks" Silva for... sending this particular piece of Oddware to me. I actually put out a reach just to see if anybody had heard of this thing on Twitter.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003426.wav|I don't mind it so much, but I wouldn't say that it's a must-buy by any means. All it is is some new stuff that isn't too spectacular and launches a very weird trait that lets your Sims have theoretical woohoo with their cars.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000598.wav|You can also just forgo a lot of the searching by checking out the alchemy store community lot. Though it's expensive and they don't have everything, so chances are you'll still have to roll your own for the best potions.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003550.wav|I agree there, this is something that we totally could have done without. And I would have rather had an expansion or game pack right now, but is this particular one worth buying for $10 anyway?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001147.wav|Kind of similar in theory to the stuff that you would see especially for consoles back in the 1990's, but this one plugs into your printer port of all things. And yeah, let's just see what all this does.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001591.wav|packaging. That's appropriate, I suppose. But let's just take a look at each of these things and see what $150 got you back in 1997.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001480.wav|It really is just little images. I mean they're just little LCDs right there. That's about what I expected, to be honest.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000784.wav|Another "Sims 4" Stuff Pack already? Didn't we just have one like four weeks ago, or am I going crazy? Well, the jury's still out on the latter, but as for the former, yep!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001492.wav|Let's just go with this one. Yay, Crash Mode!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001697.wav|It feels fine. We've also got a pint glass here. That's a pint glass in the cup holder!|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000611.wav|You also get beehives. For keeping bees. In hives. Handy-dandy stuff if you fancy ingesting bee barf, or if you need things like honeycomb and bees for concocting elixirs.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003222.wav|So uh. Now what? Well I dunno, whatever man!|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002276.wav|But having butlers back is nice for those moments when you're tired of taking care of household chores yourself. And I really do like that drink globe.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001108.wav|I almost need to hold it like right here. In fact... Get rid of this whole thing. I don't need a two and a half foot long– This makes more sense.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001762.wav|Ohh! That went about like how I thought it would. Terribly.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002558.wav|All right, time to take a look at the fourth game pack to The Sims 4: Vampires– wait a minute! Hold up. Toddlers were released?|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003369.wav|And this should, yeah that is the... Uh huh. Now the thing is...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000301.wav|Cuddle, make out, or even woohoo under a blanket right in front of the gondola driver. It's only weird if you think about it, so just don't, and enjoy.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001085.wav|It's USB. Really, it just tells you to plug it in. And, uh, that's it. I mean, it's... There's nothing there.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003119.wav|So, I don't know if I'm gonna have room enough for all of the rear brackets, we'll see. Eh, that's enough of the preamble though.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000995.wav|In fact you could just call the Dystopian Future the Dirty Future because really everything is the same, just a bit dirtied up. It's not so bad here really, just some extra smog, an occasional pile of useful garbage.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003156.wav|Just not gonna look at it, not gonna look at it behind the curtain. Can't put it off any longer, we're gotta go with the tape deck.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000070.wav|Hooray. The 73rd Stuff pack to the Sims 4 is here. This one is imaginatively titled Toddler Stuff, costing its usual $10 or your regional equivalent.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002583.wav|Those sexy coffins. They're multi-use, by the way. Fun fact: Vampires make irresistible lovers. But if you've seen any young adult fiction in, I dunno, the past decade, then you already knew that.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000123.wav|There's a nice pile of stuff here, and the atmosphere of living in a city is always a welcome option in my book. However, it's still The Sims 4 and I'm not so fond of its overall design philosophy, as you may be aware.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001133.wav|I'm gonna cut it off right there. I could say more and do more, but I don't think that I need to. It kinda got the point across there I think in those delightful demonstrations.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001580.wav|is that the little sensor for the finger... measures galvanic skin responses, or GSR. This is like temperature and heart rate and electrical impulses...|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002206.wav|Anyway yeah, traffic! In particular, heavy traffic is treated like a disaster if it gets bad enough, which makes sense being how utterly debilitating it can be to your city.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003392.wav|any day of the week over this atrocity. This thing feels... really bad. On the other hand, it is letting me play games like this... pretty okay.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0001092.wav|It does that, but what it also does is change the orientation of the ball underneath. Or, the sensors there.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0003589.wav|Ahh edutainment law breaking and risk taking? Ya gotta love it! The more you risk, the greater your potential reward and the greater chances for failure.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000522.wav|And yes, it took me a little longer than I'd initially hoped, due to a few things. Mainly, an unexpected week-long trip, but also 'cause, I gotta be honest, it didn't excite me very much.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0000238.wav|You can make fountains, but they just kind of sit there, wasting virtual water and rusting spare change. There's no swimming in the game of any kind, for that matter, and as a result, no bathing suits.|0

/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002856.wav|This is a phenomenal addition to the game, at least if you're into this amount of tedium. A happy consequence of this is that it also signals the return of shopping, at least where things like clothing and furniture are concerned.|0
/mnt/datadisk01/envs/styletts2/data/StyleTTS2_new/Data/wavs/T-0002757.wav|In short, it's a lot like life, and I really appreciate the effort that went into making each interaction a bit more meaningful to their development. It's not completely game changing, exactly.|0
